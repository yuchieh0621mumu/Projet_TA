This must be done in a harmonised manner and at international level.
Only in this way can obscure and illegal practice be traced and penalised more easily because - and this appears to me to be the key problem - the discrepancy between the legal and illegal arm trade is becoming increasingly smaller.
The globalisation of world trade make arm cheaper, more readily available and more difficult to trace.
According to Oxfam, fifty-five percent of the total trade in light weapon is illegal.
Needless to say, a stricter code of conduct only make sense if the Member States assume their own share of the responsibility.
In certain air- and seaports, arm control leaf a great deal to be desired.
In addition, cooperation with candidate country must be stepped up in this area.
They may subscribe to the code, but in certain case act a the hub of the illegal arm trade.
Some will claim that the code of conduct is not ambitious enough, but it is better to have a code of conduct which is flawed than not to have one at all.
In any event, future annual report should contain more complete and transparent information, and the code of conduct should become legally binding in due course.
This code of conduct is a first step in the direction of greater coherence, but I share the rapporteur' s hope that we will not leave it at that.
Mr President, the real solution to the whole problem of arm export and arm production is that we should convert to non-weapons production.
We are in the 21st century now.
The technology and expertise that is available should be used for something constructive in society, something that will benefit people rather than something that is going to annihilate and destroy people.
We should be focusing on the conversion to non-weapons production instead of on how we will compete with the other weapon manufacturing country around the world.
Countries with very few resource and very little money are coerced and forced into buying weapon when they should be using that money for social and health problem in their own country instead of contributing to insecurity in the region and in many case to the abuse of their own people with these weapons.
We only have to look at Indonesia and the fact that the European Union could not wait to lift the arm embargo, or to not reinstate it.
That wa deplorable.
If you look at the other country in Europe which are now getting involved in the arm industry it is extremely disturbing.
I come from Ireland, which ha a track record of non-weapons production and no involvement in the arm industry.
Now I find that contract for arm and component for arm are increasing every year.
In Northern Ireland, where there is a so-called peace process one of the big company that ha come there and been welcomed with open arm is Raytheon one of the biggest arm manufacturer in the world.
That is a complete contradiction in terms.
We should tackle this.
We should keep the arm industry out.
That is not where we should be providing jobs.
We should be providing job for people in something that is constructive and positive for society.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, the fact that we are debating the code of conduct is a positive step.
Nonetheless, several legitimate question arise.
Is it possible for those who used their weapon in Yugoslavia to murder civilians, destroy building and bridges, and cause irreparable destruction to the environment, and those who murdered, and continue to murder, child in Iraq, to be really interested in arm control?
Is it possible for those who acknowledge that the European arm industry is important both economically and strategically to be sincere when they say that the external action of the European Union must be inspired by the value of democracy and the protection of human rights?
Rather, a ha already been said, they are far more concerned that their weapon will end up in the wrong hands, or that their act of aggression will accept enemy fire from weapon they have made themselves.
But the weapon are already in the wrong hands, and we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that procedure such a the code of conduct could put a stop to the act of aggression and crime of the new order of things.
We are convinced that the existence of the code of conduct is not the result of the philanthropic feeling of those who inspired it, but of the intensified resistance of people against the barbarity of imperialism.
We place our hope for a world without conflict and weapon in the universal, peaceful and, more generally, popular movement.
Mr President, special attention deserves to be paid to the European Parliament' s first report on the export of arm since the Member States adopted a Code of Conduct on this matter in 1998.
If the European Union' s action beyond it border is to be coherent in the way that the European Parliament never tire of asking that it should be, must not the priority of the arms-exporting States, in a sphere ultra-sensitive to public opinion, be that of simultaneously paying attention to human rights, conflict prevention and the European Union' s external security?
Our rapporteur, Mr Titley, is proposing a bold resolution to Parliament.
He emphasis the entirely inadequate nature of the code of conduct which, it should be remembered, is non-binding.
The code ought therefore to be made legally binding.
Controls must be tightened up, and the ultimate use to which exported arm are put must be strictly monitored In a word, the trade in death must stop.
The supervisory mechanism must above all be extended to the light, small calibre arm used in a great many regional and ethnic conflict throughout the world, which are often turned against the civil and military personnel of EU countries.
Finally, Mr Titley proposes cooperating with the United States - and why not, I might add, with Russia and China too? - in order to devise a common approach to conventional arm export control similar to that established for chemical weapon control.
The five permanent member of the Security Council, who are supposed to watch over our security, should listen to these proposal and negotiate an arrangement truly worthy of the twenty-first century a quickly a possible.
Mr President, I fully share the hope and the opinion of Mrs Morgantini and Mr Brie, whose first amendment clearly state that the Union' s aim must not merely be to establish a code of conduct on arm exports, but to work for international disarmament and to end the arm race altogether.
This should be the European Union' s fundamental objective.
Whatever the case, arm export exist and it is therefore useful and it is a step forward to have a code of conduct on arm exports, which sometimes run counter to the principle that should be the identifying feature of the European Union: conflict prevention and the defence of human rights.
We should therefore take this opportunity to make the code more efficient and to ensure that our young soldier engaged in peace mission do not have to confront, a they occasionally do, arm exported by the European Union.
There are four issue which we should examine thoroughly.
Firstly, given the diversity of policy within the Fifteen Member States of the European Union on controlling arm exports, we should seek to bring about the extension of the binding agreement that wa signed by six Member States in July of this year. There should be greater transparency to improve monitoring of this trade, a legally-binding code and, finally, Mr President, a ban on the manufacture, promotion or sale of any equipment designed for torture, cruelty or the death penalty.
Mr President, I believe that the Titley report and the code of conduct, which we are debating together today, are two initial step in the right direction. Of course, we must regard them a just a starting-point.
I would like to make a few general points, which I think may contribute to the debate.
The arm trade is characterised by the fact that the major purchaser are poor countries, which seem to be able to find the money for arm but not for anything else.
This should trouble us, since the money come from smuggling, from the sale of drug and from a compliant banking system. But the sale of weapon is often made easier by the dealer themselves.
I believe that it is not enough for u to seek out the end user.
We must seek out the producers, who must be made to defend themselves and to explain what they have done with their entire weapon production, because usually weapon smuggling start with the producer and not with any other sector.
I would like to add that, in addition to the country of the European Union, all the country of Central and South-Eastern Europe that have close tie with the EU, Cyprus, Canada and others have contributed to this positive development.
However, Amendment No 21, which I do not agree with because of the way it is worded, give me the opportunity to say that Turkey, to which this amendment refers, must send a representative to appear before this House to explain it position to us. This may seem like a different issue, but it is not.
We cannot take practical decision based on false information and distorted realities.
This relates to the specific statement made about Turkey' s behaviour in this regard.
Anyway, I repeat what I have already said: Parliament cannot waste time debating an issue without a representative from the Turkish Government providing answer to our questions. Without these answers, we are simply struggling to take practical decision based on false information and assessments.
Mr President, I do not know whether to laugh or to recoil in horror at this report.
If it were adopted, it would show up the European Parliament for what it is and for what it is good for.
We have a situation in which the sale and manufacture of arm constitute a massive waste for humanity, a situation in which the market for this highly individual trade consists of present, future and potential war of a kind which tear the world apart, and in which arm expenditure and local war are an exacerbating factor in the underdevelopment of a large part of the planet, and yet the European Parliament proposes to regulate, and lend moral legitimacy to, a trade that ha no use for ethical code and regulations.
The report even ha the temerity to present arm export a a mean of preventing conflicts, combating poverty and promoting human rights.
The weapon used to target and kill a Palestinian child in cold blood is no doubt a product of the duly regulated, ethical arm trade, a no doubt were the bomb dropped upon the former Yugoslavia and the fragmentation mine left in Africa.
Given that armament are the flagship product of international trade and a huge source of profit for a number of large industrial group which like to think they are respectable, the only role left to the European Parliament is that of attaching the fig leaf of hypocrisy to the traffic in arm and the loathsome state of affair which enables it to thrive.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Separating financial control function
The next item is the report (A5-0260/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 and separating the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function (Article 24, paragraph 5, of the Financial Regulation) (COM(2000) 341 - C5­0293/2000 - 2000/0135(CNS)).
Mr President, I am pleased to see so many member of the public here today because, a everyone up there can see, there are very few people down here at this time of night.
Today's debate mark an important step in the reform process that wa initiated by the Prodi Commission just over one year ago.
It is the very first legislative proposal to be considered by this House a part of the reform package.
The proposal to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function flow directly from the recommendation formulated last year by the Committee of Independent Experts, which Parliament endorsed in my report of 19 January of this year.
This draft legislation is more important to the future of the Commission than it le than thrilling title suggests.
In it first report the Committee of Independent Experts stated that internal control and internal audit were entirely separate - even conflicting - activities, which do not belong in the same department.
They reached the conclusion that a priori control and internal auditing are activity which employ completely different technique and address completely different concerns.
The arrangement whereby they have been kept together within the same DG should be reviewed.
Internal auditing must play an effective supporting role in the service of the Commission so that the latter can exercise it responsibilities.
With that aim in view, the human resource allocated to internal auditing should be greatly increased.
In addition, internal auditing must take it place independently.
The Court of Auditors took the same view in 1997, when it wrote that there wa a latent conflict between the power to grant approval - and thus expenditure - and the responsibility for subsequently evaluating the same expenditure in accordance with the criterion for sound financial management.
The Commission's fast-track proposal seek to implement the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts by creating an internal auditor who operates separately and independently from the financial controller.
I have no doubt that it implementation will be one of the key to the success of the reform package announced by Vice-President Kinnock in April.
I am proud of the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control ha been able to agree unanimously on a draft opinion within a very short period of time.
Many thanks, therefore, to the other member of the committee for their help and in particular to Mr dell'Alba, whose work a rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets proved invaluable.
Let u hope that the Council will now take a leaf out of our book and develop the same sense of urgency.
While our committee welcome the broad gist of the Commission's proposal, my report present a number of change which must be made in order to make the proposed separation of power work.
I cannot help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the Reform White Paper, the Commission failed to focus properly on the detail.
The change proposed by our committee are designed to clarify the Commission's text, to impose certain minimum reporting standard and to tailor the text more closely to the specific circumstance of the different European institutions, all of which are affected by any change to the Financial Regulation.
First, the division of responsibility between the financial controller and the new internal auditor must be clarified.
It is not enough to state that an internal auditor must be appointed.
The Financial Regulation must also contain a job description.
Our committee's amendment seek to draw a clear distinction between the role of the financial controller who remains responsible for ex ante financial control, and the internal auditor, who is responsible for ex post control, and in particular reporting on the quality of management and control systems.
Secondly, the Commission's proposal would have the effect of making the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institutions.
While this make sense for an institution with a large operational budget or those with a relatively large administrative budget, such a the European Parliament and the Council, it doe not necessarily make sense for the other small institution which have a financial control staff of no more than four.
While these institution must have the option of appointing an internal auditor, it is sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirement on the financial controller.
It must be clear, however, that this distinction can only apply during a transitional period.
When the recasting of the Financial Regulation is completed, hopefully within one to two years, it must apply fully to all institutions.
Some member of the committee have argued that the appointment of an internal auditor should be made compulsory for all institution at this stage.
Of course such a notion ha superficial appeal, but if it lead to the appointment of at least 20 additional official without a clear prospect of direct efficiency gain it should be resisted.
It is important, however, that institution which do not employ an internal auditor take the job of internal audit seriously.
I wa surprised to discover that in at least one of the smaller institution no audit were carried out by the financial controller despite the clear requirement to do so in the Financial Regulation.
The third change to the Commission's proposal contained in my report is therefore the spelling out of a minimum reporting requirement.
One of the problem Parliament ha faced in recent year is a lack of standardised information on financial control from the institutions.
I therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual report detailing their activities.
Finally, institution must learn from each other instead of constantly reinventing the wheel.
My report proposes that the annual internal audit report produced in one institution should be made available to all other institution to enable them where appropriate to apply the conclusion arrived at elsewhere to their own management and control systems.
As I have already reminded the House, this proposal is only the prelude to a full recasting of the Financial Regulation.
Parliament ha not yet received the official text of the proposal but we have been able to see a preliminary version of the text and although I hope the full text will be forwarded to Parliament soon I also understand the Commission's wish to ensure that the text is legally and linguistically watertight.
It is a very substantial document.
Some in Parliament have already referred to it a the "beast", but it is going to be one of the most important item of legislation before u during the term of this Parliament.
One of the key change advocated by the Commission is the abolition of the system of ex ante financial control.
This proposal doe not meet with unanimous approval in this Parliament as, the Commissioner well knows.
Many Members are concerned that the existing system of financial control will disappear before a new system which now exists only on paper ha been proven to work.
We have therefore asked the Commission to give u an undertaking that during the transitional period which is about to begin the system of centralised ex ante control will be maintained and will not be affected by the introduction of the internal audit function.
I would ask the Commission to confirm today the undertaking it ha already given Parliament in relation to this point.
I would, however, like to make my personal point of view very clear.
I welcome the proposed change in principle.
As the Committee of Independent Experts pointed out last year, most of the irregularity highlighted by the committee stem from decision approved by the financial controller, that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the approval is a myth and put forward two strong argument for changing the system.
First, ex ante checking, whether it be universal or based on sampling, is unlikely to be a cost-effective process.
The effort put into checking all transaction is clearly disproportionate, while sampling is unlikely to have sufficient deterrent effect.
The second and fundamental principle is that any retention of ex ante control run up against the crucial objection that, de facto if not de jure, it displaces responsibility for financial regularity from the person actually managing expenditure to the person approving it.
Although the Court of Auditors ha never explicitly backed abolition of centralised ex ante financial control and we have yet to hear it view on the proposal at present before us, it ha raised the possibility of moving to a different system.
In it 1997 opinion it wrote: "As for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval, this would not be acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedure that provided at least equivalent safeguard and that could also involve financial official other than the financial controller."
The Commission's challenge will be to convince Parliament that it can create those safeguards.
Mr President, this evening, we are discussing the tightening of control on expenditure by the European institutions. An important topic, I might add, a Europe ha a bad reputation among it electorate in this area.
Too much European money disappears to unknown destinations, both at Brussels level and within the Member States. The objective of the Commission proposal we are discussing today is to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function.
The Van Hulten report is right to define further the discrepancy put forward by the Commission and set the right tone for exchanging best practice among institutions.
There might be some reservation with regard to the exception Mr Van Hulten make in his report for smaller institution where the appointment of auditor is concerned.
However, I can understand the pragmatic reasoning behind this idea.
I too believe that the staffing level in those institution are too low to warrant extra manpower.
I would like to pay special attention to one point in particular, namely the fact that the separation of ex ante control and the audit may not have any bearing on the position of ex ante control.
After all, these are administrative-official institution where the option of ex ante control remains an absolute necessity.
This doe not mean that permission must be gained from the financial director for the purchase of every single pencil.
What it doe mean, however, is that an assessment is carried out, according to modern method on the basis of risk analyses, to find out in what case of expenditure ex ante control is absolutely essential.
It also mean that ex ante control must still be required when the service request this.
If this possibility were not to exist, this could lead to a situation in which people no longer dare take decisions.
Also important is that the ex ante control continues to be carried out independently, admittedly in a decentralised manner, but certainly not under the Director-General of the Directorate-General under scrutiny.
In summary, independent audit are compulsory but cannot be carried out without modern and efficient ex ante control. The two are strictly separated but jointly responsible for the sound supervision of the European institutions' expenditure.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in this House support Mr van Hulten' s report and therefore also the unanimous decision and proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control.
So - nothing against an independent, internal audit service, to which we are giving the green light today with Mr van Hulten' s report!
A professional audit is an essential component of modern management in the public and private sphere.
However, a good audit is not in itself a miracle cure.
I will not name any name here, but one could give a whole list of company where renowned auditing firm have attested that all is well, only to find a few week or month later that they have collapsed.
That is why I find it worrying that the Commission is obviously still intending, a before, to introduce the new audit service not a a useful complementary service but a a substitute for the traditional financial control.
As previous speaker made clear, that mean it is on a head-on collision course with a majority in this Parliament, which after all is responsible for scrutinising and assessing the Commission.
Nor, unfortunately, is the independence of the new audit service beyond all doubt.
Under the so-called fast-track procedure we are discussing today, the Commission guarantee that independence, but the draft document on the general reform of the Financial Regulation, of which we already have a provisional version, is a step back again in that respect.
Why, for instance, Commissioner, doe the Commission not want to grant the internal auditor the power to initiate proceeding before the European Court of Justice in the event of his independence being impeded?
And is the independence of the internal auditor not also impeded if - even before he is appointed - a fait accompli is established by recruiting his staff in advance?
We have other example of where that leads.
We need only think of OLAF.
Here too the Commission faced the new director with a fait accompli by simply transferring the entire team of the former UCLAF task force to OLAF, even though it wa clear that some of the official were totally unqualified for the job.
Result: the new director may come from the outside, but he immediately find himself ensnared in a system that is already firmly established.
I hope we will not see a repeat performance here!
I can understand the Commission wanting to show that it can produce quick results; but when you talk to Commission officials, you get the sense of a mood of growing depression over the past months, and not only among the so-called losers, for of course some people are bound to lose out in any reform.
Like several Member States, I think there is still some doubt a to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefit it will produce.
We are still starting out from the simple idea that in the end the purpose of reform is to achieve greater efficiency.
Today we still do not know whether it will and until we do I would advise this House to take a rather sceptical view of the European Commission' s reform process.
After all, we owe it to our voters!
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur.
I have a feeling that these kind of topic, and this report, are right up his street, and I would almost go so far a to say that it is not a coincidence that this sitting is so well attended this evening.
The proposal under discussion is a direct result of the report by the Committee of Independent Experts.
An internal control service is to be set up.
Yet, my group feel it is too early at this stage to make a final decision on centralised ex ante control or decentralised ex ante control within the Directorates-General themselves.
We need to give this some more thought and weigh up the pro and con very carefully.
I also believe that, a far a this is concerned, we need the advice from the European Court of Auditors.
We cannot make a decision until we have the proposal on the new financial regulations, and within the framework of the discussion on these new regulations, a number of aspect will need to be laid down definitively.
We will be backing all amendment which help clarify the division between financial control and internal audits, a currently proposed.
We are also in favour of providing information more effectively.
In our view, there is one note of discord in the report, although this is not the view of the entire group, and that is the question: should internal control only be set up in respect of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, or should it also extend to smaller institutions?
In my opinion, it should also apply to smaller institutions.
This may not be practical - it is indeed the case that only a few people deal with financial control in those institutions, but the principle that the person who give ex ante approval also self-assesses after the event is wrong.
These two activity should always remain separate.
This also applies to smaller institution even though they have fewer staff.
If we lay something down for large institutions, the neutrality principle proposed by the Committee of Independent Experts should then apply across the board.
I am not in favour of making any exception to this rule.
Otherwise, my group is able to support all the rapporteur' s amendments, especially those which stipulate that annual progress report should be compiled.
Public opinion is so sensitive in this area that I feel this Parliament should deal with this topic every year, and not only at the discharge stage.
It should also deal with the question of how matter can be improved in term of control, and, in the light of public opinion, we cannot do enough about this.
Mr President, our group also support the rapporteur and thanks him for his good work.
I think the Committee on Budgetary Control held important discussion on this subject and the Commission would certainly be well-advised always to draw on that committee' s authority during the further reform process.
I believe that constructive cooperation really can make a contribution to improving the reform.
We believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management.
We support the Commission' s step in that direction.
But we also have some criticism regarding the question of final control.
We too believe there is a need to look again at the situation with regard to the independent final control.
All this ha to be brought together again in the form of overall responsibility on the part of the Commission.
We also support those group that are already thinking about extending the reform to the small institutions.
I believe the administration ha to be modernised at European level in all the institutions.
Parliament certainly still ha something to learn too and there is room for improvement in it own procedures. We hope that in general with this process we will manage to restore European public confidence in the European institutions.
In future, the administration must be able to react more quickly.
We expect great gain from that.
In the past we often found that excessively lengthy decision-making process disappointed the applicant and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions.
Modernisation can do much to allay that.
But the annual audit report process is also important; it must not be confined to the discharge but must be continuous, in the form of annual report through which we pinpoint where progress can be made, so a to restore confidence at that level too.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr van Hulten' s report wa very broadly endorsed in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
No doubt the same will happen during the vote here in plenary.
So, my compliment to Mr van Hulten, but may I also ask the Commission to interpret this endorsement correctly.
By it we are showing that we continue to support the reform it ha embarked on. We want these reforms.
They must lead to greater transparency and efficiency in the handling of the taxpayers' money and help improve the control systems.
We need these reform so that we can manage substantially to speed up the payment to the legitimate recipient of aid and at long last reduce the number of budgeting error the Court of Auditors criticises every year.
Setting up an independent - and I emphasise the word independent - audit service is a step in the right direction and responds to Parliament' s request in it January resolution on the reform of the Commission.
However, we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control.
That is another thing this House decided in January and confirmed again in the 1998 discharge.
Unlike the internal audit, the traditional form of financial control check budgetary process even before agreement are signed and payment made.
These ex ante control are essential because, unlike their national colleagues, the Commission official have wide discretionary power in many area of financial decision-making.
Independent counter-checks are essential in order to avoid errors.
If in future these audit are conducted decentrally and in a targeted manner for risk areas, we will also manage to prevent the control from being too unwieldy.
It is essential for the financial controller to remain independent, which mean they must not come under the same directors-general they are checking.
In short, the controller must not be under the order of those whom they are checking!
Parliament ha repeatedly made that clear too.
Unfortunately, we are still waiting in vain for a signal from the Commission in this respect.
I would ask the Commission to take the necessary step together with Parliament!
That is in the Commission' s interest too.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr van Hulten on this very thorough report, which ha deservedly received the unanimous support of the other member of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I wish to say, Commissioner, that this report is only an interim measure, which mean that it is the first step towards building a bridge between our present system of control and the system that we would like to achieve through the reform.
The draft version of the reform of the Financial Regulation is still not available in all languages.
Furthermore, the White Paper states, quite unnecessarily, that at the end of the interim period, the Council will be able to take into account whether or not the Financial Regulation ha been approved.
The need for legal certainty requires u to bring forward the deadline for this interim period, which ha given rise to many reservation in this Parliament, since it seems that we want to have our cake and eat it; in other words, we want to move ahead, but without giving up the precaution that are currently in place.
There are overlaps, which mean that responsibility is being diluted. Expenditure is doubling but there is no assessment of posts, and so many people are doing the same thing.
The staff involved are neither being given responsibility nor being motivated.
This interim period, a stated in the White Paper presented by the Committee on Budgetary Control, is being extended indefinitely.
I urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the interim period end a soon a possible.
We know what we want and it is the will of this Parliament, but it is crucial that the transitional period should not be extended beyond what is strictly necessary.
I therefore feel that, when it come to drawing up and suggesting the agenda for the Presidencies, you should not ask u to head straight for the objective we wish to achieve, regardless of the time needed to make the change in the audit.
There ha also been a certain carelessness, of which I am sure the Commissioner will take note, so that we will, a soon a possible, achieve the aim of this reform which we began with the van Hulten report.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, the Commission' s great reform project a summarised in the White Paper is primarily aimed at boosting efficiency, i.e., at making a real improvement in financial management, covering in fact every aspect of the budget.
In future the money is to be spent in a more targeted and effective manner, and of course we also want a better guarantee that the fund are actually spent for the purpose decided by the budgetary authority.
That is the primary aim and my colleague, Mr Kinnock, ha repeatedly set out all the step we will take in seeking to achieve it, for the reform process consists of a great many measures.
Let me point out that we have already implemented a large number of these individual steps, be it in relation to workplace definition or to setting up a central financial service in the Budgets Directorate-General, to name only two important ones.
We are now concerned with amending the Financial Regulation, a process which in fact only began in 1998 when people realised how important it is to conduct not only an ex ante control, but also an internal ex post control, i.e. to have an internal audit service.
It is only since 1998, with the seventh amendment of the old Financial Regulation, that the independent financial controller ha been responsible for both activities.
Shortly thereafter, the Committee of Independent Experts informed u that this system is not the ideal solution either, because it contains latent conflicts.
Regardless of whether such conflict have in fact arisen, there is a potential for conflict.
That in itself can lead to the question whether the person who gave the go-ahead for expenditure ex ante really is in a position to conduct an accurate ex post control - with the necessary objectivity.
If even the slightest impression could arise that the controller might no longer be independent, that is reason enough for u to split this function again.
That is the proposal before us.
It ha also been pointed out that this proposal should, of course, be incorporated in the general revision of the Financial Regulation, but since that revision will take quite a long time - if only because it is such a complex business - the Commission ha asked for this single issue to be decided in a fast-track procedure.
On the question of the Financial Regulation in general, let me say very briefly that I really am very sorry that the revised version is still not available in all the languages.
I personally will do my utmost to speed thing up, so that Parliament finally ha this document in all the languages.
I want to thank both committee - the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets - for this intensive debate and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell' Alba, who wa unable to be here today.
I really do appreciate the fact that Mr van Hulten made such personal effort to find a good solution for this change to the Financial Regulation and thus to get this key component of the reform up and running.
Turning now to the proposed amendments, let me say briefly that the Commission approves the insertion of the extra recital.
This recital - a also the amendment to Article 2(a) that you proposed - relates to your concern, expressed here, that the financial controller' s function of ex ante control could be weakened during the transitional period.
That will not be the case, because we have decided - speaking only in term of post now - that 80 post will be available for this ex ante control during the transitional period.
Let me point out again - since misunderstanding sometimes arise here - that ex ante control is in fact based on a sampling method.
In the past, 10% of operation were controlled, which, however, accounted for 89% of the total budget.
That is why this always ha to be taken into account too.
The percentage ha now been cut to about 80%, but it is based on a risk assessment.
That mean that we have 100% control for some high-risk areas.
I can understand the concern that in the absence of this ex ante control - before the money is spent - a deficit could appear.
Of course the Commission ha taken note of Parliament' s concern here.
So I can only underline again that we have developed a very accurate procedure for checking whether the individual Directorates-General that are to be responsible for this ex ante control in future are in a position to conduct it.
Only if they are able to do so will we revert to sampling, to selecting, which is often controlled.
Obviously that is a guarantee that must exist.
Let me say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2, which - most importantly - provides for an annual report by the financial controller, to ensure greater transparency.
In my view, the concern set out in Amendment No 3 is also most important, namely that a differentiated approach should be taken to the different institutions.
That mean the Commission, the Council and Parliament must under all circumstance separate ex ante control from the independent audit service, while the small institutions, which do indeed have a far, far smaller operational budget, should be free to choose whether to separate them.
That is, of course, also a question of experience.
Perhaps it will be concluded at some point that this should be made compulsory; but for the time being it should be left to their discretion.
I think that will also make it easier to implement this reform.
I really find this proposal so useful that I am only sorry I did not think of it myself.
But that also show how important it is for the Commission and Parliament to interact constructively.
Let me therefore thank you for your proposal and your opinions.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Parental control of television broadcasting
The next item is the report (A5­0258/2000) by Mrs Angelilli, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee: Study on Parental Control of Television Broadcasting (COM(1999) 371 - C5­0324/1999 - 1999/2210(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner Reding, lady and gentlemen, this report on the possibility of establishing parental control of television broadcasting in order to protect minor tackle an issue which is extremely important and topical, all the more so when we consider the growing number of television programme on offer and the increasingly wide and increasingly uncontrolled distribution of the Internet.
To this I would add two further observations: on the one hand, the number of minor with direct access to television and computer is constantly increasing and, on the other, there is a worrying increase in the broadcasting of violent image - portraying all possible type of violence - both in television programme and over the Internet.
For example, last week in Italy, a racket trafficking paedophile pornography via the Internet wa uncovered. This discovery wa then broadcast on the television network.
However, some of the image taken from the site investigated were also shown, causing great consternation amongst the citizen over the unscrupulous use of such pictures, which are or were certainly inappropriate and harmful for the minor who were watching television at the time.
To return to the report, a you are aware, the European Commission is preparing a report on the implementation of the 'Television without frontiers' directive, to be published in the next few months. Guidelines and consideration on the protection of minor must be included in this report in an appropriate manner.
I would also like to point out that Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specifies that all the Member States must take appropriate measure to ensure that broadcast by television broadcaster do not include any programme which might impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular programme that contain pornography or gratuitous violence.
Therefore, we are all aware that, in practice, this is certainly not a simple undertaking.
However, in the light of these considerations, our task is to define the objective which we can reasonably expect to achieve in order to be able to establish genuine, reliable protection for minors.
Firstly, we must identify all the technological system in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or Internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors: I refer, in particular, to filtering system and programme classification systems.
However, we must also take into account the introduction of the digital system, which will facilitate the use and broadcasting of such programmes.
Secondly, we must specify that, in addition to the technological control system which I have mentioned, a further two element are essential to prepare the ground, so to speak.
Firstly, we must promote the development at national level of information and awareness-raising policy targeting family and the world of education in general.
Secondly, we must encourage producer to take responsibility for the quality of television programme and broadcaster to take responsibility for broadcasting procedure for these programmes.
Clearly, we cannot attempt to harmonise legislation on the protection of minor in that, under the principle of subsidiarity, each Member State is sovereign in this matter, but also because cultural and moral concept and therefore view on these issue differ widely from country to country: for example, there are difference in the definition of who exactly is a minor and the definition of violence, etc.
However, having said this, if we are to produce more than empty word to protect child we do need to provide clear recommendation on the protection of minor in the medium context.
I would like to summarise the proposal made in this report which I feel are most important and most viable in practical terms: firstly, the setting up of an group of expert consisting of high-level individual appointed by the Member States to contribute to the definition of common criterion for the protection of minor in the medium context; secondly, the establishment by all the operator in the sector of a code of self-regulation in respect of the protection of minors; thirdly, the possibility of promoting filtering system and making them available for use on both television programme and the Internet.
I would like to end by saying that, in accordance with the vote which took place in committee, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 4 tabled by the liberal group or Amendments Nos 5 and 6 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, whereas I welcome Amendments Nos 2 and 3 tabled by the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, today we are debating a report that gave rise to much controversy when it wa discussed in our committee, all sparked off by the term subsidiarity.
But at a time when we not only have a surplus of audiovisual offering but also excess consumption of these offerings, we cannot retreat behind the word subsidiarity.
As politicians, we simply have a responsibility, in all the area in which we act, to protect young people from that surplus.
At a time when we are witnessing so much violence, hatred and intolerance in all our countries, we surely have to ask ourselves where it is coming from.
Now, I cannot say: it all come from television.
But no doubt much of it can be traced back to the excessive consumption of these television offerings, some of which incite to hatred and intolerance, including intolerance towards other nationalities.
So we must give serious thought to how we can check this.
We have a responsibility towards minors!
Subsidiarity is to be welcomed. And we want to preserve it; but I beg you, let u not hide behind it.
It is our job to do something, and indeed we have already tried to introduce this kind of protection of minor with our first "Television without frontiers" directive.
I am thinking now of Mr Hoppenstedt, who fought for the V chip.
But what can we achieve with that kind of technological barrier?
Not much; child usually know how to handle it better than adults, which mean we really must think very seriously about how to remedy this situation.
We do not intend to replace anyone who is doing a good job at national level, but we do want to introduce common criterion and minimum requirement at Community level and propose rule that help people effectively to implement measure to protect minor in their country.
Of course I also think that we are not in a position, either a politician or a technicians, to tackle this problem on our own.
Far more important than all this, of course, is the role of the teacher and the parents, and handling this medium correctly.
Television and the Internet have to be learned and, of course, also taught.
So what we are doing today is just a small part of the job that society a a whole ha to perform.
I believe we must bring up our child to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parent to encourage their child to watch suitable programme and disregard the le suitable ones.
That is why we should do both, do our job a politician and urge society to do it bit.
Unfortunately, I cannot endorse the Liberals' demands.
I find them too liberal and not really geared to the interest of the minority we are considering here.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, Mrs Pack, how much television violence can a child tolerate?
The question is not nearly a easy to answer a some people think.
And that is one of the finding that ha come out of the highly commendable "Study on Parental Control of Television Broadcasting" that is the subject of the Commission communication.
Despite an impressive number of international studies, there is still no clear evidence of any direct link between violence and medium consumption.
Someone may commit a particular act under the influence of an image seen on the media, but that doe not mean that the cause of that act is also to be found in the medium image.
That is a most important finding, for we must not overshoot the mark in our legitimate concern for the well-being of child and young people and, in particular, we must not mistake the real cause of the sad reality of youth violence.
Youth violence is the result of a build-up of several factors, such a experiencing violence in the family, suffering serious social disadvantages, having poor chance for the future because of lack of education, which lead to frustration, which in turn find it outlet in violence.
That fit in with the experience I myself have gleaned during ten year of voluntary jury service at a number of juvenile courts.
Technical measure to control television offering cannot resolve these problems.
Fortunately, however, the vast majority of child and young people grow up in an environment free of all these type of problem.
That is the best youth protection there can possibly be.
Here we see parent who are committed to passing on their own moral value and life experience to their children.
As a rule these are rooted in a particular cultural, social and societal background.
Systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis.
That is also what the Commission is seeking to do, with reference to the finding of the study.
Basically, the report we are to vote on here also support that approach.
At the same time, of course, no-one dispute that medium image can influence moral values.
But we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter systems, that in no way take away from broadcaster responsibility.
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport ha therefore called in so many word for the programme and provider responsibility to be established.
That is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation, although it certainly doe not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic value in a dialogue with all concerned at European level.
Finally, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport also considered it important to urge the Commission to extend all youth protection measure to multimedia offering of all kinds, since image of violence and other harmful content are certainly no longer confined to conventional television.
Europe' s child have been surfing the Internet for a long time now, and they are doing so more and more.
It is more important for the child and their parent to learn to use the medium properly than to introduce legal restriction and electronic filters.
That is an educational and social task.
Mr President, Mrs Pack is right.
We are concerned here with the proximity principle.
The EU is facing a number of challenge - enlargement towards the East, the intergovernmental conference and the Treaty in Nice.
These question are at the top of the agenda.
The problem relating to democracy and to the EU' s closeness to the people are other crucial issues.
It is a question of the EU' s political legitimacy in the eye of the people - and time is rather pressing.
I believe that solving these problem is a prerequisite for the success of the European project a a whole.
In his splendid major speech yesterday, President of the Commission Romano Prodi mentioned that, for the sake of the EU' s political legitimacy in the future, it will be necessary to produce a list of those subject the EU is to deal with and those which the Member States are to deal with.
I entirely agree with the President of the Commission about the need to prepare such a list along the line of a constitution, and I am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the EU must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of area in which the political problem are not of a cross-border nature.
The EU should stick to the key political issues.
In so far a the President of the Commission ha had any idea about which area belong where, I hope that he share my view that issue of parental control of children' s television viewing do not belong on the EU' s agenda.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have therefore tabled a number of amendments, the purpose of which is to limit the effect of this report in so far a it may be adopted.
Allow me finally to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is also concerned about the increase in the number of TV programme containing sex and violence.
We are also convinced that these programme are in no way of benefit to viewer and certainly not to children.
But, all other thing being equal, I think it is the job of parent to prevent their child from seeing that sort of thing at home.
Mr President, our sitting is not being broadcast on television!
It would be good for the world to be able to see your imposing figure presiding over the House, and a live television programme broadcast at this time of day showing our alluring Commissioner would be just the thing.
But there are no television camera here. We are not being filmed.
Sadly, a the previous speaker have said, our television show scene of violence and rampant sex, some of which feed money into the State coffer through the infamous advertisement publicising sex chat lines, and yet we, the European Union, ban the sale of toy containing phthalates - and rightly so for they are dangerous if child put them in their mouths.
It is not enough to leave parent to keep watch over their children: we ban the toys!
That is what we do.
And why, in this case, then, do we not just ban all programme which are harmful to u all?
Oh, no. In this case, we leave parent to keep an eye on their children.
But consider how often are parent at home, how often they have to go out.
We should also ban mobile phones, the WAP phone we hear so much about, which all the youngster will soon be carrying about town, putting their life at risk from traffic because they are watching television programme and absorbed in material from all the different States of the European Union displayed on their mobile phones.
I do not, therefore, agree with the word of the Liberal Member who ha just spoken.
I am afraid that the heaven and the satellite will soon be raining signal from all over the Union down on all our States.
And it is therefore important for a European directive to be adopted to prevent the transmission of harmful material.
Mr President, Commissioner, our child access and use televised, printed and new medium on a daily basis and a a matter of course.
Information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge is delivered to the home in record time and our child can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis.
At the same time, a huge selection of different entertainment programme is available to them, usually without any controls.
Aside from all the positive aspects, we must not disregard the negative side-effects of this ease of access.
Children are being faced day by day with a growing wave of medium brutality and violence, which is simply too much for them, especially because no limit are imposed on these offerings.
So all those concerned, starting with the children, via the parents, the teachers, the countries, the European Union and, beyond them, the supplier and producer must come to grip with this question and learn how to deal with these offering and their effects.
The public must be made more aware of the effect of this constantly growing wave of violence and support measure must be taken.
Parents are in particular need of help here, and in the following form: parameter to protect minor in the medium context throughout the European Union, the introduction of filter system available at low cost, legislation to protect minor and assumption of responsibility by the media, enterprise and private and public-sector providers.
These measure must not be restricted to television but must apply to all accessible media.
The candidate country must of course also be integrated in this process even at this stage.
Since the medium market is a matter of supply and demand, i.e., a question of hard business, the provider pay no attention to the consequence of various offerings.
All that count is the ratings.
So we must introduce protective mechanism that are impossible, or at least not easy, to circumvent.
Furthermore, I believe programme that help reduce and overcome violence and aggression should also be on offer.
No doubt they could not be marketed so spectacularly and would therefore produce lower ratings, but in return they could make a considerable contribution to damage limitation and to combating the adverse effects.
We are responsible for ensuring that our young people can shape a future society in which violence and aggression are not presented a hip or cool or a example to be copied but a deeply reprehensible.
We have to match up to that responsibility by adopting the appropriate directive and providing the necessary support.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, one Sunday evening a fortnight ago in the South of France, Johan, aged 17, and Robert, aged 16, murdered their childhood friend, Romain, with a firearm and a baseball bat, for no reason or motive, just like on TV.
Arrested very soon afterwards, they told the police, "It' s funny, they don' t get caught that easily on the telly."
They also said that they wanted to see what it wa like to kill someone in real life.
This occurred not far away and not very long ago.
It happened on 17 September, close to home, in Europe.
There is no question of simplifying matter or engaging in generalisations, even if we do have a limited time for speaking in the European Parliament, but there are a great many examples.
It may be remembered that, a few year ago, Oliver Stone' s film, 'Natural Born Killers' , generated the same controversy by giving rise to copycat crime by youngster in the United States and France.
So when I hear some people stating in debate in committee that there is nothing to prove that television violence in all it form may have a harmful influence upon children, I am, to put it mildly, surprised.
We are often alarmed at the television programme our child watch.
The on-screen violence of all kind to which child are subjected, whether it be on television or through the computer, ha short-, medium- and long-term consequences.
The purpose of this report is to help us, a parent and grandparents, to protect minor and to provide u with a tool enabling u to make better, informed choice for our children.
Just how is that an attack on the principle of subsidiarity?
The audiovisual medium continue to be the exclusive domain of the Member States.
At no point doe the report suggest potential harmonisation.
At the very most, the talk is of tentative convergence.
With regard to the protection of minor in the medium context, the definition of common criterion is therefore, of necessity, minimal, given the cultural, moral and social variation in our Member States.
Establishing minimum criterion is the very least the European Union can do for it children.
I would also support the rapporteur when she explains the need to make sure that all family are guaranteed the right to an affordable filtering system.
That being said, these device must not, and cannot, exonerate broadcaster and educator from fulfilling their responsibilities.
Children will very quickly learn to manipulate these filtering system better than ourselves.
Legislators - and I have almost finished speaking now - cannot regulate everything, but they must occasionally remind everyone what their right and duty are.
I believe that that is what we are doing today.
Mr President, I should like to thank both the European Parliament and it rapporteur for the important work which ha been done on this issue.
I remember that, when the V-chip wa discussed in this House, I wa among the MEPs who banged their fist on the table and demanded that parent have the opportunity to exercise supervision.
The Commission share the view expressed in the report that cooperation between Member States and the Commission is essential if minor are to be better protected over the next few years.
This doe not mean harmonisation.
No one want this, no one ha talked about it and no one intends to implement it.
The idea is to draw up minimum rules.
I am the last person to attack subsidiarity.
I defend it, because it is essential.
Subsidiarity must serve some purpose, however, and not act a a screen.
I am convinced that, when it come to protecting young people, we are in prime position of responsibility, and I am also convinced that there are ethical consideration more important than the strictly legalistic ones.
With regard to the introduction of a self-regulation code, it should be noted, particularly in term of the technical aspects, that, in a number of Member States, broadcaster have already introduced coding system for television set to enable parent to cut off the power.
The Commission is also consulting the Digital Videobroadcasting Group, or DVB, about the technical aspect of system for protecting minors, particularly digital filters.
Like Parliament, the Commission also think that each family ought to have access to these filtering device at affordable prices.
As you know, however, no effective system are yet to be found where television is concerned.
However, filter are available to the public for use with the Internet, and this should speed up the development of similar filter for television, especially digital ones.
In short, when more programme are put on the market, parent will have the technical mean of preventing their child from watching certain broadcasts.
Let u not, however, forget the ethical and legal aspects.
The problem is certainly not to be solved at the touch of a button or just by pulling a plug.
As ha been said in this House, journalists, programme maker and broadcaster are also responsible.
I should like to remind you that the Commission ha adopted an action plan designed to promote safer Internet use and also to make user more aware of the problem.
I think too that, even if this public awareness campaign relates to the Internet, it will also have a knock-on effect on television programmes.
It is true, a Parliament acknowledges, that the Member States do not share the same idea about what minor should or should not be permitted to see.
The report considers there to be good reason for aiming at progressive convergence, even if it is premature at this stage to define the criterion involved in such convergence.
Although I do not think it is feasible to adopt uniform criteria, I think it is our responsibility to arrive at some classification of the content of television programmes, while leaving parent the option of deciding whether the programme may or may not be watched by minors.
I should also like to say something in response to the content of a national television channel which showed offensive picture on the pretext of providing information.
Let me tell you that, in journalism, there ha always been an ethical code and a system of self-regulation for applying this code, and this ha operated quite well, I have to say.
There are always exceptions, when thing go wrong, but exception are precisely what they are and all the more shocking for being so.
In my opinion, the profession ha to be made more responsible so that it take responsibility itself for the content of broadcast and for what will and will not be shown.
I myself wa a professional journalist for twenty years.
I will tell you something: journalist cannot write and show everything they know about or are aware of, or divulge all the information they have, because it may do a lot of harm to third parties.
In it report, Parliament also invite the Commission to encourage the creation of a think tank with the job of drawing up a memorandum containing the basic legal principle applied in the Member States for the purpose of protecting minor in the medium context.
The Commission will respond to this invitation because, a you know, we are due to table the 'Television without frontiers' directive again in 2002, with a view to testing the water.
I think it will be very important, in that context, to launch a broad debate on our society' s responsibility where the medium are concerned.
When I say society' s responsibility, I am thinking not only of European government but also of political responsibility at national level, the responsibility of medium practitioner and the responsibility of parent and of society in general.
I am also very aware of the remark made about education, about training in the interpretation of image and about making younger people more aware of the need to approach the medium in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing, at any time and in any way.
I would also say that the industry ha already devised an international system of self-regulation called the Internet Content Rating Association, in which the Commission participates.
Consideration could be given to encouraging the creation of a similar initiative covering audiovisual content.
Your thought on this matter would be welcome, a they would be in the context of 'television without frontiers' .
Where, finally, the protection of minor is concerned, I should like to point out that there is a Council Recommendation of 24 September on promoting national framework designed to ensure comparable and effective level of protection of minor and of human dignity.
There are plan for the Commission to prepare a report for Parliament and the Council on the measure taken by the Member States to apply this recommendation.
The objective of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach proposed, an approach based on the principle of self-regulation, and my official have just set the work in motion and have sent a questionnaire out to the Member States.
One thing is certain, I think.
The problem will not be solved through technical, technological or other such measures. It is society a a whole which ha to assume responsibility.
We are in the process of assuming our own share of responsibility.
Let others assume theirs and, believe me, I shall call for everyone to play their part in applying a solution.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Education and training: mobility within the Community
The next item is the report (A5­0255/2000) by Mr Robert J. E. Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on mobility within the Community for students, person undergoing training, young volunteers, teacher and trainer (COM(1999) 708 - C5­0052/2000 - 2000/0021(COD)).
Mr President, this report cover a very important issue and one that ha been prominent in my post bag for nearly six years.
If we are serious about the European ideal, we have to be able to ensure that it is easily sold to those who are convinced about the concept and those who are not.
I wa a teacher for 16 year and now, a an MEP, I have spent a lot of time in schools, colleges, and at conference arguing for just this sort of action.
It link in with many positive initiative over the last few year with which we are all familiar - Socrates, Youth for Europe, Leonardo and so on. Young people in general are very positive about the European Union.
They do not have the problem often associated with other age groups.
They are used to multicultural and diverse communities.
But confronted, a they so often are, by factor that work against the European ideal, they rely on their own experiences.
We have to ensure that the experience of young people - student and others in the educational world - are positive.
Nothing will be more damaging to their developing views, than if a report such a this fails to make progress or if it fails to deliver greater mobility or if it fails to at least start to demolish the barrier that confront educational mobility today.
Back to the beginning.
When it first presented it report, the Commission accepted that it recommendation wa le than satisfactory.
I understand that it even considered withdrawing it.
Since then, a great deal of work by my own staff, by Parliament's staff and indeed by the Commission's own staff, to all of whom I pay warm tribute, ha presented u with what I thought, until today, wa perhaps a worthy if not perfect report, certainly one that wa satisfactory and would go some way to achieving my aims.
Today, and at the eleventh hour, the Commission have advised me, albeit indirectly, of it difficulties.
Firstly, I understand that the Commission now belief that all reference to researcher to be outside the legal base a provided for under Articles 149 and 150.
I ask the question: why is this information only available on the 4 October?
Why ha someone waited until now to come up with this?
Was this legal advice not known when on numerous occasion I discussed it inclusion with member of the Commission staff?
Indeed, when Mr Mantovani and I and the whole Social Affairs Committee were encouraged to progress the case, why wa I told that the researcher would be the subject of a later Commission recommendation if there is no legal base for it?
And why in 1996 did the Commission publish a Green Paper - Education, Training and Research - if there wa no legal base for it?
Was that, I ask, not a waste of Commission and Parliament time and indeed money, then and now.
No-one ha more respect than I for Mrs Reding and her Commission staff so I am sure that tonight in her response she will be able to address the particular point that I raise and that she will not present a prepared statement.
I will now turn to some of the particular which I addressed in the report - detail which were defined and honed in response to discussion with a huge number of parties, from student to ministers, teaching union to government, representative from several, if not all, the countries.
The report seek to remove legal and administrative, and indeed cultural, barrier to mobility.
It promotes the wider use of a variety of financial mean of assistance.
It try to promote an EU-wide area of qualification and specifically to make the lot of third-country national easier regarding mobility.
Specifically my report replaces the worthy international generalisation by, in effect, repatriating the decision to the Member States.
I tried to make sure that the report only cover area over which Parliament and the Commission ha jurisdiction.
I have endeavoured to ensure the recommendation with any fiscal implication are limited to a bare minimum.
As with any Parliament report, experience ha shown that there is little chance of anything happening, or at best little possibility of uniformity across Europe, if there is no monitoring.
For reason which I understand, but which will have the effect of neutering the whole report, the Commission will, I am led to believe, be rejecting Amendments Nos 46 to 51.
Indeed, they have already press-released it to the effect that they are going to do so.
Commissioner, I say to you that without an action plan, without any indicator to see who is doing what, and how well they are doing, without assessment of progress, there will be so many discrepancies, so many complaints, so many letter in your post bag, so many student and teacher knocking at your door, and indeed so many MEPs lobbying you, that I suggest you will wish, even allowing for the constraint under which you work, that you had accepted the amendment I proposed and which I hope Parliament will accept.
In conclusion, I wa both pleased and flattered when this report wa referred to by President Chirac in his speech to Parliament some week ago.
If the French Presidency are now serious, then I suggest that Council will have to work very hard to salvage both their and the Commission's reputation a a matter of urgency for I suggest the failure to endorse this report in it entirety will send all the wrong, and very confusing, message to important group of our society.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
(IT) Mr President, a draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on this proposal for a recommendation, I would like to express my satisfaction at the end document, which wa the result of a joint effort by Mr Evans, Mrs Martens and myself. I would especially like to thank Mr Evans and Mr Martens for their fruitful cooperation.
During the ninety the Commission produced several recommendation on the issue but no practical solution were found.
I therefore hope that, this time, a solution will be found once and for all, so that mobility throughout the European Union - of students, young person undergoing training, young volunteers, teacher and trainer - will become one of the crowning glory of the European Union, putting paid to that paradox whereby it is easier for goods, capital or service to move within the European Union than it is for the citizen themselves.
The problem to be resolved vary from country to country: for example, regulation differ on matter of social security, study grants, right of residence and taxation, and there is no system for the mutual recognition of qualification and work placements.
Then there is a dearth of information on opportunity for mobility and there is the barrier of the lack of knowledge of languages.
I would draw attention, out of the amendment tabled, to the inclusion in this recommendation of the specific category of researchers, since this category wa originally included in the Green Paper.
I am firmly of the opinion that, rising above the problem of organisation and coordination, which cannot be avoided for they are a result of the reorganisation of the directorates-general of the Commission, it is vital to support and foster research in Europe, for research is a fundamental vector for the growth, international competitiveness and development of the Member States, particularly if we compare the situation with that of the United States and consider the negative implication of mobility problem which are driving young researcher to go to the United States rather than attempt to move within the European Union.
This is why the category of researcher should be included, Mr Evans.
I therefore call upon the Member States to make every endeavour, alongside the Commission, to resolve the bureaucratic and other problem of mobility, and to set specific goal in the form of a two-yearly action plan and a final report.
This is the very minimum necessary if we are to achieve that area of freedom which is the basic right of every European citizen.
Mr President, in my capacity a draftsperson of the Committee on Petitions, I should like to congratulate Mr Evans on his excellent report on the mobility of students, researcher and person undergoing training and to thank him for having taken the concern of our committee into account.
Of all the petition we receive, many relate either to mobility within the European Union, and in particular that of students, researcher and person undergoing training, or to the recognition of qualifications.
The difficulty encountered by the petitioner are due, on the one hand, to the lack, or the complexity, of legal text and, on the other hand, to governments' failure to respond to the seriousness of these problems.
The Commission need to draw up a list of the problem encountered by European citizens, particularly with regard to the issue of freedom of residence and freedom of establishment and, most especially, with regard to their right to work, study and obtain recognition of their qualification in other Member States.
This list must be accompanied by practical measure such a the establishment of objective to be achieved by the Member States and the obligation on the latter to prepare periodic report on the progress achieved.
Student mobility would be improved if the period of study completed in each Member State, together with the qualification and certificate acquired, were to be fully recognised within the European Union.
The European Commission should take ambitious initiative designed, in the short term, to provide for the reciprocal recognition of academic qualification between Member States.
By responding to the problem of daily life, this European Parliament and Council Recommendation should make it possible to bring Europe closer to it citizens, in particular it youngest citizen who should be the force involved in creating a European identity.
Mr President, the 1996 Green Paper on mobility list the obstacle to mobility.
Four year down the line, we have to recognise that very little ha been done.
There are still major obstacles, for example in the field of social security, health cover, extending residence permits, taxation, etc.
I lament the fact that, a a consequence, young people are prevented from gaining experience - study, work or other experience - in another Member State.
It is about time that Europe turned it attention once more to the sound implementation of programme such a Socrates and Youth for Europe.
It is thanks to these programme that young people can come into contact with the thinking, the language and the culture of other countries.
This is why these programme which promote student mobility are so crucially important.
After all, the experience which these people gather contribute to a broader understanding of European cultures, they enhance professional experience and the command of languages, encourage familiarity with the European patrimony and increase the chance of finding employment.
This is why threshold need to be lowered on behalf of students, volunteers, university teacher and researcher - yes, I include researcher in this a well.
In line with the 1996 Green Paper on mobility, this group should also benefit from the recommendation in this report.
I believe that the European Commission wa wrong to exclude them.
As is apparent from the report by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, there are still many thresholds, and during my work visit in my country, I hear many complaint every time, not only about the obstacle to mobility, but also about the implementation level, the red-tape involved in applications, the number of body which carry out the same inspection and late payments.
Some outstanding payment date back a far a 1996.
The French Presidency ha prioritised improved mobility for this target group.
Mr Evans ha done sterling work and thanks to sound cooperation, the Culture Committee approved the report on mobility unanimously last month.
This is a sign that the continuous obstacle to mobility which stand in the way of students, volunteers, university teacher and researcher should be swiftly removed.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, promoting the mobility of students, trainer and teacher is being seen a an ever more important part of the European strategy.
It wa given attention, for example, in Lisbon last March at the summit there, in which matter of employment, social participation and the information society were focused on.
In the Lisbon conclusions, mobility wa recognised a an essential element in the information society and in the promotion of lifelong training.
Robert J. Evans' s report therefore discus an extremely important issue.
The greatest credit go to the rapporteur for an approach based on the point of view of the public and the practical problem involved.
Mobility is not to be promoted by noble objective but by removing the day-to-day obstacles.
I hope that the main amendment adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport will be received positively by the Council, a they deserve to be, and that legislation is speedily brought into effect.
When it come to student and teacher mobility, experience show that the real problem of mobility are not found so much in the area of educational administration, but with the social, tax and immigration authorities.
Problems with regard to retaining social security benefits, transferring benefits, and taxation still hamper mobility within the Union.
Questions of responsibility have also been raised, especially when it is a matter of on-the-job learning.
Regarding our own problem in the education sector, we cannot steer away from the difficulty there are in approving study credits.
Students are still pretty much dependent on the good will of the lecturers.
If that is missing, study abroad might unduly extend the actual length of time a person studies.
I am very glad that the rapporteur pay attention in his report to the opportunity for national of country applying for membership to be included in the recommendation on mobility.
The most serious problem at present concern those coming from non-member countries.
Improving their status will be an effective way of building a common Europe.
What is also important in this report is the attention given to the equal treatment of those who are the most disadvantaged, for example, the disabled.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Evans and Mr Mantovani for their work.
This is an important report, although it doe leave major question mark and give rise to serious doubt in certain areas. This report is a natural full stop to the conclusion reached in the Green Paper, which highlighted the remaining barrier to mobility, mobility which is not, a Mr Mantovani said, simply a question of good and capital but must indeed be mobility of persons, with all the spiritual, human and cultural wealth which they can take to the different country and thereby enrich them.
Our group - the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party - ha tabled amendment which include the category of researcher in the recommendation: we are therefore in favour of including researchers.
Moreover, we would stress that, although the proposal is certainly a firm step in the right direction, in our opinion, there are certain gap which will require us, or rather the Commission, to work on eliminating all the remaining barrier of an administrative, legal, linguistic and cultural, but also financial nature.
At the same time, it need to produce active measure firmly promoting the teaching of at least two Community language in every country and developing and supporting the cultural and linguistic education of our young - and not-so-young - citizens. This should include the use of new method and new technologies.
We also agree that there is a need to give all those who participate in this mobility system clear, comprehensive information regarding their social security rights. In addition, we agree that direct and indirect tax such a the tax payable for renewal of residence permit should be abolished immediately.
Certainly, a Liberal Democrats, we agree that this mobility system should be extended to include the candidate country a soon a possible, and we would like to express our regret at the continuing delay in the mutual recognition of qualifications, an issue with which Commissioner Reding is quite familiar and which we know to be very important to her.
Commissioner, we call upon you to act incisively within the Commission on this unresolved matter, so that, in full respect for national power and sovereignty, we will indeed be able to talk of a Europe of peoples, a Europe of citizens, but also a Europe of culture.
For if Europe is not a Europe of culture, it will never be Europe!
Mr President, I would like to join my colleague in thanking the rapporteur for the tremendous work which he ha done on this report and also to congratulate the member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Petitions who have drafted opinions.
This is a very sensitive subject because, a my colleague have already pointed out to the Commission and Council, a lot of hindrance are put in the way of students, lecturers, people undergoing training and volunteer with regard to mobility within the Community.
Freedom of movement for persons, goods, service and capital is enshrined in our treaty and yet young people, who are the future of the European Union and perhaps have fewer prejudice than some of u adult are denied opportunity because of the bureaucratic barrier put in their way.
The SOCRATES Programme wa mentioned a one example of this.
A survey carried out by the Commission in 1998 on the ERASMUS Programme, covering 10,000 students, showed that le than 50% of the available place were actually taken up on a full-time basis and that over 60% of the student who took those course encountered financial difficulties.
What this highlighted wa that unless some serious remedial action is taken on the financing of the ERASMUS Programme and the kind of support that is made available to students, there will be inequality between those whose parent can afford to send them and those whose parent cannot.
I spoke on this issue in this House in the last session, but I would once again urge EU education minister to grasp the nettle and make sure that proper initiative and proper funding are put in place. I would also call on the Commissioner to ensure that in the next round of proper funding is available for the ERASMUS Programme.
One point I would like to raise finally while we are on the subject of mobility is the ongoing case in one of the Member States of the European Union with which I have been involved for the last five years, namely the question of foreign lecturer in Italy.
Despite several opinion from the courts, recommendation from Commissioners and action at Council level, nothing ha been done to regulate the position of these foreign lecturer whose status wa reduced by the Italian education minister.
Action need to be taken to ensure that those inequality do not continue.
I would commend this report to the House and recommend support for the amendment put forward by Mr Evans.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish, informally but nonetheless from the heart, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Evans and Mrs Martens, a well a the draftsperson of the opinion, because to my mind, these issue have not been addressed so directly, sincerely and authentically for a very long time.
I believe this to be political honesty, even if it is not pleasant to hear.
We have spoken many time about mobility and the shortcoming that exist in it regard.
I would say that in Europe we are currently living in a climate of considerable moral fraud.
Fraud, not necessarily in the eye of the law, but certainly moral fraud, because we are sending student to other country and then we give no recognition to their study and nor do we give them certificates.
This is moral fraud, in which we are willing partners.
What can we do?
I think that we can do a great deal.
As the Commission and Parliament, we can demand compliance from programme that are funded by the Commission.
We cannot allow university not to recognise qualifications.
Europe' s universities, in France, Spain and elsewhere, are autonomous and have the power to decide whether they will recognise diploma and the subject that have been studied.
Universities that do not comply, however, must forfeit their subsidies.
There must be clear check and monitoring, even if only of a sample, and above all, a web site, where student can register their complaints.
This is not expensive at all.
We are not only protecting the right of young people, since the same applies to researchers.
It is pointless to talk about lifelong learning if we ignore researchers.
Mrs Reding, Mr Busquin and his Directorate-General are not doing anything about the training of researchers, nor about the recognition of postgraduate qualification or about doctors' training.
This ha today created a void in the European Union and unless the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport address the problem, Europe will probably not be in a position to compete in the media, in the cinema or in research in information technology.
Our human resource are our only future in a world in which there is no more valuable commodity than knowledge.
We cannot allow this field to be taken away from us, even if this make thing uncomfortable in term of the European Parliament working closely with the Commission.
I think we should ask Mr Prodi to do everything possible to ensure that young people studying abroad do not feel like orphan and that researcher are not left without support, at the mercy of what their rector decide.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, it is our declared aim to make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge society in the world, an economic area that is able to achieve sustained economic growth with more and better job and greater social cohesion.
So we must make every effort to close the existing gap between word on paper and the actual, practical difficulty the European citizen still encounter every day.
Here, the European dimension in the field of education and training play an important role.
We must, therefore, ensure that the freedom laid down in the Treaty such a the right of residence and free movement, do not remain empty words.
Transnational mobility is not just an occupational and economic requirement but call for a forward-looking basic approach.
Precisely for that reason I am still very surprised to see how many obstacle remain to greater mobility and flexibility in Europe.
We therefore call for research worker to be included in the scope of the recommendations.
We call for measure to dismantle the existing obstacle and to ensure that person undergoing training can enjoy social security and other benefits, to prevent the risk of double taxation, to promote the learning of at least two Community language and to develop mean of financial assistance.
Finally, we call for measure to create greater transparency in the recognition of qualifications, period of study and training.
We call on the Commission to play a more active role in promoting the mutual recognition of training certificates, which advance mobility and flexibility, so that we really can achieve our declared aims.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, may I first of all thank the rapporteur and also all those, in the relevant committee and in this Chamber, who have committed themselves to making mobility a reality.
Believe me, I know what you are saying, and a lot more besides.
It is through practical action and not through green or white paper or, for that matter, black or red ones, that problem are solved.
And what we have here is practical action.
Believe me, it is not easy.
Do not imagine that, by setting a recommendation down on paper, there will be cheer of joy from all the Member States.
No, a number of Member States will have to be forced to eliminate obstacle of a kind which may seem ridiculous.
However, there are still definitely barrier to the removal of these obstacles, and I have not finished persuading all the Member States of the fact, but I am still optimistic.
I am an optimist for two reasons.
First of all because, a a European Commissioner, if I want to make progress, I cannot allow myself to be pessimistic; and secondly because, in spite of all the problem of which I am aware, hundred of thousand of student and hundred and thousand of parent and grandparent thank me when I meet them and tell me that the experience they were able to have wa terrific.
Go into the street and ask young, and not so young, people which European programme they have heard of, and they will tell you - Socrates and Erasmus.
So, in spite of the persistent problems, of which I am aware, these programme are of positive value and contribute something to the people of Europe.
I agree with you that the obstacle which still exist need to be removed.
I would thank you for your cooperation on this matter.
It is easy to talk in a speech about removing obstacles, but le easy to remove them in practice.
What is more, most of the problem of which we are aware do not stem from the Commission but from the Member States and even the regions.
What, then, is the state of play regarding the financial problems?
Mrs Pack, you are witness to the fact that the Commission and Parliament had agreed between themselves to request more money because they knew very well that the Erasmus grant were not enough and that only those who received help from their parent or grandparent or who worked during their Erasmus study had the opportunity of benefiting from these Erasmus grants.
All right, what wa given wa given.
You have to make do.
That is why I have asked the ministers, since they have not given me any more money, to ensure that supplement to the Erasmus grant are offered in their countries, and this is something we are discussing.
Last Saturday, I wa in Paris for a Council of Ministers for Education, exclusively on the issue of mobility.
Things are moving, and not just in the abstract.
The rapporteur quoted President Chirac' s word on mobility.
The French Presidency wish to make mobility one of the key issue of it term of office, and will go on to do just that.
In November, the Ministers of Education are going to take a decision not only on this recommendation, which is a small step in the right direction, but also on an action plan to be implemented in order to facilitate mobility and turn this into a reality.
At the Council meeting in Nice, mobility will be one of the item for discussion.
So you see, thing are moving.
Not everything need to be seen in negative terms, because there is a lot of progress.
I would say to you, however, that, for thing to continue to move, some pressure need to be exerted.
So, help me to apply some pressure.
You are doing so today and will do so tomorrow.
I should like to thank you right now for doing this.
I should also like to say that the French Presidency is not the only one to have made progress in this area.
The Portuguese Presidency did a marvellous and very useful job of preparing the ground, and I should like to pay tribute to both Presidencies for the way they wish to make progress.
The Lisbon Summit wa something of a point of departure for a long journey which we are only just beginning.
Our Heads of State and of Government and the regional and national government have realised that education ha a role to play if we want to develop the economic and social side of the European Union.
The creation of a Europe of knowledge is therefore a very important step in the right direction, but we still have a very long way to go.
I have no hesitation in telling you that we shall do more than just talk. We shall take practical steps, but it cannot happen overnight.
We have to keep chipping persistently away at the issue and never give up applying the pressure. However, we shall get there.
With regard to the amendments, the following may be accepted: 4, 5, 11, 12, 16 to 18, 25 to 27, 28, 30, 31, 33 to 38, 40, 41, 44, 52, 53, 54 and 55.
I am also able to accept the following amendments, a reworded: 7, 9, 13, 20, 23, 29, 32, 42, 52 and 57 on the basis of the English text.
And, finally, I am able to retain the following amendment in part: 6, 10, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24 and 42.
That is almost all of them.
Let u now turn to the amendment which present problems. These concern researchers.
Ever since the beginning, it ha been more or le clear that researcher could not be part of the recommendation.
However, a is it proper role, Parliament ha exerted pressure for researcher to be included in the text nonetheless.
The Commission ha responded to Parliament, and these problem were tackled in a communication adopted on 18 January on the European Research Area and, in the follow-up to this communication, Commissioner Busquin will be presenting a communication on the mobility of researchers.
There will therefore be a specific communication on this subject, and I think it is partly thanks to the pressure exerted by Parliament that this is going to happen.
Allow me now to return to Amendments Nos 46 to 51 which, with a view to ensuring that the recommendation is followed up, request the Member States and the Commission to put in place a process which might be considered similar to the Luxembourg process in the case of employment.
I agree with the objective, but there is an important reason why the Commission ha adopted the position it ha on these amendments, and that is because, by accepting them a they stand and in their present proposed wording, the same problem would arise a when we speak about the action plan which the minister and the Commission want to have finished drafting by November.
Considerable new human resources, which do not exist at present, would be necessary.
I did not want to leave the matter a it stands.
That is why I spoke about it this morning at the meeting of the Commission, and the conclusion drawn by the Commissioners wa clear.
Following the communication of the 26 July on matching human resource to the institution' s tasks, the Commission cannot accept new task unless the budgetary authority allocates it the necessary resource for carrying these out.
This is a position of principle, to be applied generally and not only to what is of concern to u now.
It is a collegiate position adopted by the Commission, in view of the decision taken, in view of the peer group and in view of staffing problems.
From now on, the Commission will give the same answer on all topics.
The budgetary authority will therefore have to ensure that we have the material resource for taking action.
That being said, I should nonetheless like to remind you that the Commission already ha a monitoring system which will be placed within the framework of the new open method of coordination, recommended by the Lisbon European Council.
This open method of cooperation is based upon the assumption that European guideline will be established, the implementation of which it will be possible to adapt in relation to regional and national diversity.
It will also, however, enable monitoring to be carried out periodically so that the Member States can progressively develop their own strategy where mobility is concerned.
I think, Mr Mantovani, that, over and above the question of principle that bind me to the Commission' s collegiate decision, there is an avenue to be explored here, and it might perhaps be necessary to look for alternative in this area.
In any case, I am happy to have a discussion with you to see what can be done in this respect.
Finally, the Commission cannot adopt Amendments Nos 8 and 58, the former because the Lisbon conclusions, which have already been listed in recital 11, encourage the Member States to take the necessary measure to promote mobility, and I can assure you that the Member States are proceeding along the right lines. They demonstrated a much last Saturday in Paris when, for a whole afternoon, they discussed the issue in depth and made commitment to mobility.
A good start ha been made.
Finally, Amendment No 58 cannot be adopted, quite simply because it duplicate Amendment No 37 proposed by Parliament on the same subject.
I think we are on the right road to reaching an agreement on the content, without necessarily having to resort to a second reading. This would allow the Education Council to adopt a text on 9 November enabling the French Presidency to present the Nice European Council with the 'mobility' package requested by the Heads of State and Government in the conclusion to the Lisbon Council.
We all want the same thing.
We want there to be real progress on this issue in the real condition in our region and our Member States.
I should also like to do much more when it come to the recognition of qualifications.
At the moment, and a the Treaties at present stand, it is a national responsibility, which is not to say that I am not doing anything.
I am in constant discussion with ministers. I also know that account ha to be taken of the autonomy and independence of university but, by mean of our network systems, we have brought the university closer together, and they engage ever more frequently in joint venture and recognise student from other university and study completed in those universities.
Things are moving slowly, and that is frustrating because the objective can be seen there before us.
It is a fine objective, and we should like matter to move more quickly.
In politics, thing do not, unfortunately, always move a quickly a one would wish.
If, however, the pressure is kept up, we shall get there.
So, help me to do just that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting wa closed at 11.12 p.m.)
Address by Mr Ciampi, President of the Italian Republic
Mr President, it is my great honour to welcome you to the European Parliament.
I hope I will be forgiven for mentioning the excellent memory that I cherish of my official visit to Italy last March, the especially warm welcome I received, that you gave me, Mr President, and the depth and clarity of your approach to Europe.
Your visit today come at what is a crucial time for European integration.
We do of course have good cause for rejoicing in this regard, and we were talking about this a few second ago, following the adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights last Monday by the group that make up the Convention.
We are conscious, Mr President, that you have promoted this Charter right from the outset.
You even believed in this project at a time when it was, for some, more a utopian dream than a tangible prospect.
On many occasions, you have reiterated your desire for the Charter to be granted genuine legal effect.
Even if the future of this text is now in the hand of the European Councils at Biarritz and then at Nice, this House look forward to the result of these negotiation with a sense of optimism.
This optimism ha been heightened in recent day by the numerous intervention that we have heard from the Member States.
But now is also the beginning of a key stage for the Intergovernmental Conference.
At Leipzig on 6 July, you issued a call for a vision for the future of Europe, based on a draft constitution.
We would like to join with President Chirac and Minister Fischer in saying how much we value this move.
It is one that ha initiated a genuine political debate on the future of Europe, and I have no doubt that your speech today will provide u with an opportunity to take this debate still further.
Mr President, you can be sure of this Chamber's commitment to this great European project.
We, for our part, are sure that we can count on a telling contribution from your country, whose action have always been decisive each time that a major step is taken towards European integration.
Thank you, Mr President, for having shared with u your belief and your ambitions.
You have delivered a speech stamped both with idealism and with resolute realism. It is a speech which, I can say in all sincerity, ha provided u with a source of encouragement and optimism.
You have outlined, in an admirable fashion, the major challenge facing Europe today - institutional reform, control of the economy, the issue of defence and enlargement - and I have noted that you view these a a political imperative, but also a an ethical imperative.
Your intervention is also an act of faith in Europe, and one that you propose anchoring in our civil society.
You have stated that you want the Charter of Fundamental Rights to become the first part of a Constitution, and it cannot have escaped you that this idea tally with the wish and will of a large part of this House.
You have reminded u of the responsibility that Europe has, within the international community, for establishing value in the field of democracy and human rights, and of the dramatic event in the Middle East.
The event in Yugoslavia, which give cause for hope but which are also at a highly critical stage, are also being followed by this House a closely a you would expect.
We are aware, it is true, that much is expected of Europe and of the European Parliament.
We were particularly conscious of this, Mr President, last September, when we welcomed the Speaker of the Knesset and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, who came here together, to this very rostrum, to deliver a message brimming with peace and hope.
Finally, you have demonstrated your confidence - and I would thank you for this - in the role played by the European Parliament and in the cooperation between our institutions, and more especially between the European Parliament and the Commission.
The way in which this House received the very powerful speech made by Mr Prodi yesterday showed not only that this cooperation is harmonious, but also that we have shared ambition for the future of Europe.
You can rely on our institution to bring their full weight to bear to reach solution which are commensurate to the challenge we face.
(Loud applause) (The formal sitting wa closed at 12.35 p.m.)
Equal opportunity
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Council statement on: Equal opportunities; equal participation by men and women;
the report (A5-0198/2000) by Mrs Dybkjær, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the Commission annual report 'Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union - 1997, 1998, 1999'.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, this is the third time I have had the pleasure of addressing the House since the French Presidency began. I first addressed the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities on 11 July and, on 5 September, I made a statement about the monitoring centre for industrial change.
Today, I am here to talk about balanced participation by men and woman in all area of society.
The motion for a resolution on the Commission' s report that you will be voting on later go into great detail on the subject.
I would like to comment on three point highlighted by Mrs Dybkjær, and I commend the quality of her work a rapporteur to this House.
First, a regard the need for regular assessment and monitoring of equality at every level regarding work, employment, education, training, family life, health, and the dignity of women, we will only be able to make significant progress if we have the most accurate intelligence on every aspect underlying discrimination.
The second point relates to the new information and communication technologies.
This emerging sector is opening up greater access to the world of work for women.
We must make sure the gap in this area are reduced.
We must make sure woman benefit from the new job generated, while avoiding reproducing the inequality that exist in more traditional sectors: le skilled jobs, part-time work (sometimes not by choice), insecure contract and difficulty put in the way of access to decision-making posts.
Thirdly and finally, I think the proposal to make implementation of the principle of equal treatment a selection criterion for any Community aid or funding is essential to promoting equality.
Because equality is a major political issue we are going to use a number of event to give it prominence during the French Presidency.
I am primarily here today, of course, to discus those events.
We have organised a Ministerial Conference in Paris.
It will be held on 27 October.
I have naturally invited Mr Rocard, my eminent fellow countryman, the Chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and Mrs Theorin, Chair of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
We will also be organising a Conference on Professional Equality on 24 November, bringing together experts, social partner and company managers, to look at the obstacle in the career path of women.
I shall not, however, be talking about the Conference on Professional Equality so much a the issue I have put on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference on 27 October.
Three issue will be tackled, and they are issue also dealt with in the Presidency' s major documents, either in the Fifth Action Programme or the Social Agenda.
The three subject on the agenda for the Ministerial Conference are balanced participation by woman and men in decision-making, combining work and family life, and including equality in several structure of the European Union Council of Ministers.
The first issue, women' s participation in decision-making in all areas, show the serious deficit woman still suffer from today in comparison with men.
That is a democratic deficit which is le and le tolerated nowadays.
Perhaps some of you remember the Paris Conference of April 1999, when we reached agreement on a statement, but, with fifteen Ministers, had great difficulty deciding on a plan of action with quantified targets.
That is why I decided to seize the opportunity afforded by the Presidency' s major documents, this time, to move that action plan forward.
I can tell you that my country ha now marked a crucial milestone a regard women' s participation in decision-making.
Very briefly, a reform of the constitution wa adopted on 28 June 1999 in France, with the support of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic, and immediately afterwards we began debating a bill on parity, which wa adopted on 3 May 2000.
This law will be applied to all elections, including local election from 2001.
So, at the risk of seeing their electoral list invalidated or not having their campaign cost refunded, the political party must present list with equal number of men and woman placed alternately to prevent woman being relegated to position where they have little chance of getting elected.
I feel sure that balanced participation of woman in political decision-making would produce a genuine renewal of our whole political life.
Such power sharing will bring with it other profound change in economic, social and cultural life.
The Beijing Platform for Action and the final outcome document of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Beijing + 5, last June, are along the same lines.
The Finnish Presidency' s report on woman and decision-making set out clear indicator for evaluating the progress made.
I also want to salute the Commission' s initiative - I think my information is correct, Mrs Diamantopoulou - in taking a decision to have parity between men and woman within it committee and group of experts.
We must all commit ourselves to following and developing this encouraging initiative.
The French Presidency would like to make progress in this matter and hope to approach it partner with proposal for quantified target for giving woman access to decision-making in all areas, the political arena, which I have already mentioned, but also economic and social sectors.
Initial consultation undertaken by the French Presidency confirm that this is a central concern in all Member States.
I do not mean to imply that we have already reached agreement on the quantified targets, but I can assure you I am putting a good deal of effort into getting that agreement.
The second issue for this Ministerial Conference will cover combining work and family life.
Following the example of Finland, a questionnaire ha been sent to all the Member States and this will be followed very shortly by a report.
A proposal on indicator to measure progress will be put before the Council.
I wa hoping to make this issue an important one in the Presidency' s programme so a to ensure continuity of the work done under the Portuguese Presidency.
I am thinking of the Evora seminar on maternity and paternity and the resolution on balanced participation by men and woman in family life and at work.
Because we know that a long a woman have to carry the burden of a double working day alone they will continue to face a dilemma between their private and family life and between their working life and their life a citizens.
Indeed, a I always say in France, lady and gentlemen, while a law to impose parity in politics is now within the bound of possibility, it is more difficult to impose parity in daily life, domestic parity, by law.
Just a the public arena should not be a male monopoly, the private sphere should no longer be the exclusive domain of women.
That is why new method of organising time must be considered, so that all those involved - parents, children, citizens, elected representatives, business - have their proper place.
This will be one of the strong point of the Ministerial Conference.
Let me add that I have also put this item on the agenda of the Conference on Professional Equality of 24 November.
The third issue for the Ministerial Conference will cover the incorporation of gender equality into the work of the various European Union Councils of Ministers.
I hope to initiate a process I have used a a working method in France, a method that work well.
For the first time, several Councils of Ministers will be dealing with gender equality by linking it with one of the item on their agenda.
To give you a couple of examples: at the Education Council there is the issue of mobility of men and woman student and teachers, because we have recognised that there is major inequality in mobility; and at the Internal Market, Consumption and Tourism Council there is an item on the development of electronic commerce so a to make it accessible to all, both men and women, because we know there is gender inequality in electronic commerce too.
In addition to the Ministerial Conference and the Conference on Professional Equality, I should also mention two very important document specifically devoted to equality, but within the area of competence of the Employment and Social Affairs Council.
I am thinking of the Fifth Action Programme and the amendment of the 1976 Directive.
On the Fifth Action Programme, I would first like to wholeheartedly thank Mrs Theorin and the rapporteur, Mrs Eriksson, for their work which will, I hope, make it possible to adopt the programme before the end of the year.
I know Parliament will be particularly concerned about mainstreaming and the implementation of strategic objective relating to equality in economic and social life, and - to return to this point once again - balanced participation in decision-making.
For my part, I undertake to ensure that the programme' s funding match up to our ambitions.
By the same token, it fall to u to review the 1976 Directive, 25 year after it adoption.
This review will not only bring the law into line with the many ruling from the Court of Justice, but will also incorporate other very important point into Community legislation.
I am thinking, for example, of sexual harassment a gender-based discrimination.
The notion of indirect discrimination will be more precisely defined and the derogation from equal treatment supported better.
This is a particularly important advance for women, a Mrs Hautala is sure to emphasise when she present her report to Parliament on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
Going beyond the specific issue falling within the scope of my ministry, I want to mention three initiatives, very briefly.
First of all, the guideline for employment, this time fleshed out with quantified targets, which propose to increase the employment rate for woman to 60% by 2010.
The role of the social partner is also strengthened, and I am very pleased about that.
Finally, in a word, the fourth pillar devoted to equal opportunity reinforces the integrated approach to equality through gender mainstreaming and through specific guidelines.
The second initiative I want to mention relates to the social agenda to be submitted to the Nice Summit, next December.
This is one of the Presidency' s great priority and, a you know, it open up a broad field of action in employment, and clearly make the point that combining work and family life make a contribution to this.
Personally, I would like to see this issue taken into account even more specifically in the social agenda.
I think we can all congratulate ourselves on the fact that the agenda contains a chapter devoted to the promotion of gender equality and, in that area too, I hope we will progress towards quantified targets.
The last initiative I want to stress concern the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
As you know, the draft is the outcome of complex negotiation which were completed on 26 September.
The document will be submitted to the Biarritz European Council in a few days' time.
I shall stress our commitment to having the article relating to gender equality clearly set out in the Charter.
I am frequently asked about this.
I know I have already used up my speaking time so I shall be very brief, but there are a few thing I need to make clear.
Three article in the Charter are devoted to gender equality.
The first is devoted to the general principle of the equality of all person under the law.
The second relates to the principle of non-discrimination, including that based on gender.
The third affirms the principle of equal pay and equal treatment, together with the possibility of undertaking positive action in favour of the under-represented sex.
Combining work and family life, entitlement to paid maternity leave, right of a more general scope, such a the right to dignity and the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity, also appear in the Charter.
So all these provision make this document an additional instrument underpinning equality.
Civil society' s expectation are high, and this ha not escaped the member of the Convention, who are anxious to have a gender-correct Charter.
In conclusion, I repeat that the Community level is the right one for making progress together in all the area I have mentioned, but it is also the right level for making progress on many other issue of concern to women.
I am thinking in particular of the violence they suffer, one of my priority for government action, and I know that is a specific issue that impels you to action too.
Any progress we make in one Member State is progress for the other Member States.
If national policy are enriched by Community policies, then Community policy must also be inspired by national experiences.
I am convinced that together - Parliament, Council and Commission, but also Member States, social partner and non-governmental organisation - we will make progress and I know - we know - that equality between woman and men is on the move.
Mr President, I should like to begin by welcoming Mrs Péry back to Parliament.
Those of u who have previously heard her in Parliament know that, with her a President-in-Office of the Council, we have a very committed spokesperson for women' s issues, and that is something we need if our plan are to succeed at all.
In the committee, we combined three report from the Commission and dealt with them together.
On behalf of the committee, I can promise that, in future, we shall attend to the report in time so that the Commission doe not feel it is engaged on a major task, but that we in the committee are ignoring the fact and not getting our report ready in time.
We have promised ourselves that this will not happen in future.
All three report - I shall return to the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council in a moment - call attention to the article of the Treaty of Amsterdam and say that, in these, we have obtained a new and sound basis for working on the issue of equality in the Commission and that we have also obtained a number of tool for implementing equality in the different Member States in a way we were unable to do before.
This is something which, a women, we should be pleased about.
We can say that almost all woman have worked hard to achieve a better Treaty where equality is concerned, and I therefore think that we can be quietly pleased with the fifteen men who sat and adopted the Treaty of Amsterdam and were therefore also involved in implementing the principle of equality, even though it cannot, of course, be said that there is much in the way of obvious equality in their own Assembly.
There is really a paradox in the fact that we in the EU have, on the one hand, an outstanding basis for equality - especially now with the Treaty of Amsterdam - but that, on the other hand, there are fifteen men in the European Council who make all the decisions, something I shall refrain from commenting further upon.
It therefore becomes obvious in one way or another that there is a difference between principle and concrete implementation.
I am also saying this because I think it is incredibly important that the EU should be given a stronger women' s perspective, and I say this for two reasons.
First of all, we have had a referendum in Denmark which clearly showed that women, more than men, are opposed to this project, and not merely the project involving the euro but the EU project a a whole.
In Denmark, we have equality in a great many areas, so woman ought not to feel threatened by the project.
We see, however, that, on many points, woman are opposed to the project to a much greater degree than men.
We therefore have some problem or other, and I will venture to say that it is not because we have declined to say that the EU is OK.
Instead, it ha to do with this overridingly male-dominated agenda, which woman have emotional reason for voting against.
Secondly, we are now facing enlargement, and we know that the progressive changeover from state-run to private enterprise affect woman more than men.
Because a great many of the country have said that they want to hold referenda, we have the major task of conveying to woman in the candidate country that the EU is good for them.
For, if we do not make a special effort in this area, I am completely convinced that there will again be a range of emotional reaction which will not necessarily have to do with the EU clause but with the fact that the EU is, all in all, a very male-dominated enterprise.
In that way, there is a risk of our seeing 'no' vote in referendum in the candidate countries, too, and of enlargement failing to go ahead.
I would therefore prevail upon the President-in-Office of the Council, both the current and the forthcoming ones, a well a upon the Commissioner, to be alert to this aspect, for I believe that it is absolutely fundamental to our work that we make a very big effort in this area.
In connection with the reports, I would also say - and the President-in-Office of the Council touched upon this, too - that one of the major problem in the EU is of course the big cultural differences.
It is therefore no wonder that the President-in-Office of the Council is having difficulty getting her action plan through.
This clearly show that the country have very different interests, but one of the thing we have to work on is trying to find out where, in particular, we can make a contribution in the individual countries.
I have a dream of our being able to obtain proper statistic for the different area so that we can obtain indicator for the labour market, education and many other matter in relation to equality. In that way, we shall be able to work on thing in very much more concrete terms.
I would very much recommend that this be done for the candidate country too, for it prof to be incredibly difficult to obtain figure from the candidate country about how responsibility are divided between men and woman in the different areas.
I believe that, if we are to be able to deal with enlargement properly, we must also have those figures.
There were thousand of other thing I could have done with saying. I can see, however, that my allocated speaking time ha run out, so I shall stop at this point.
I would, however, put a strong case to the Presidency and the Commissioner for our continuing to follow the guideline which we have indicated in the report and to which I have referred in my speech.
Mr President, Mrs Péry, Commissioner, the report that the Commission ha drawn up on equal opportunity in 1997, 1998 and 1999 are very important document and the reference to the Treaty of Amsterdam is a significant step forward.
Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, covering equal opportunity for men and woman and Article 141 covering positive measure for employment are a guarantee for woman that should take effect in all the policy of the European Union.
We are aware that woman do not participate sufficiently in the decision-making process in politics, business or unions.
They have a much smaller share in the labour market than men, a difference that is particularly accentuated in some countries, especially in southern Europe.
They do not receive the same pay for equal work, with the difference reaching almost 30 % in the private sector.
We know that measure for combining family and working life particularly favour women, although research is still needed into the current situation of the family and the role that woman play in it, which is no longer the traditional role, because society ha changed a great deal, and at the same time, so ha family structure.
It is essential that research should be carried out on the real situation of woman in the various Member States in order to guide the policy that need to be made if we are to achieve greater equality between men and women.
In order to integrate gender policy into all programmes, we must be aware of the situation from which we are starting and the objective that we wish to achieve with particular policies. Because what really count are the achievement and the advance in the situation of women.
We are aware that the majority of unemployment in the European Union is among women.
In order to achieve full employment, therefore, we need to have positive policy directed at women, which will consist both of creating job and of preparing woman for the new job - information society, new technology - in which they can play an entirely equal role to men.
The percentage of woman in work in the European Union is much lower than that in the United States and Japan, a level that only some northern European country come close to.
If we take into account the candidate countries, the problem becomes more serious a the level of woman worker in those country are even lower. Therefore, the objective of equality between men and woman should be included in all programmes.
Women have decided that they wish to work, that they wish to make their work compatible with their family life.
Women wish to take part in decision-making processes, in politics, unions, and business, and we know that the contribution of woman is positive for everyone and for the progress of society a a whole.
European Union policy should help them to take part in order to achieve greater equality between men and women.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, contrary to what the annual report which we are discussing here might seem to suggest, European women' s equality policy did not originate three year ago, but date back much further to at least twenty-five year ago.
Its launch wa accompanied by a great deal of legal creativity, audacity and lashing of political power of persuasion.
If one examines women' s equality policy now, it seems to me, a we are all gathered here - and, of course, most of the people attending and taking part in the discussion are woman - that while we are all naturally trying our utmost, we are also aware that European women' s equality policy is threatening to lose it momentum.
It ha become an issue for which you have strong feeling neither for nor against.
To put it mildly, it is in a conceptual and political vacuum.
The report we are dealing with here seem to reflect this mood.
There is a great deal of activity, reasonable sum are being spent, fantastic conference are being held, everyone doe all kind of wonderful things, but we do not know where it is all leading.
Is this policy a success?
Is it useful to draw the goal nearer?
We cannot verify this, for - and the rapporteur also mentioned this in her report - the goal of the policy are not clearly defined and cannot be measured.
What we need to do, therefore, is to formulate our goal more clearly, so that we know whether we are successful or whether the instrument we deploy are successful.
We also need to define the problem more clearly and identify the problem which the policy is trying to solve.
Twenty-five year ago, we were able to talk about social discrimination of woman a a group and about unequal treatment.
Does this definition of the goal or problem still apply? Is it still appropriate?
What are the group in society for which this definition is still appropriate?
Is it not the case that the gap caused by this social discrimination ha been partly bridged for certain group and that others group are doing very well indeed, in other words, that a kind of sham women' s equality ha been created?
In short, I would very much like u to address the question a to what the problem facing woman consists of.
What is the problem which the policy is trying to solve?
Can we reframe this using a more modern approach and can we apply a theory and set of policy instrument which will breathe new life into the policy, so that we do not continue on the same path?
I may be critical, but it might be useful to shake up the house of cards, which women' s equality policy in Europe doe appear to be, where we are all frightfully nice to each other and say everything is so wonderful.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking our fellow MEP, Mrs Dybkjær for an excellent report and welcoming her back to Parliament after her recent weeks' campaigning.
We know that Lone Dybkjær did what she could.
I am a man in an EU within which men and woman do not have equal opportunities.
It is worth repeating that.
Sometimes, some people - even colleague in this Assembly - seem to believe that they do have equal opportunities, but they do not.
Just a some people have said, it is enough to look at this Assembly: the majority are men, the majority of those making decision are men, and when the European Council meet it consists solely of men.
There is one female Head of State in Europe.
It is therefore gratifying that the European Parliament is represented by a woman in these contexts.
More woman are needed in decision-making positions, because it is quite simply unacceptable that so much human ability is being lost.
Women do have the ability - and without imposing quotas.
This week we have taken a great step closer to a reunited Europe.
Emphasising how matter stand regarding equality in the candidate country is a particularly important task in the membership negotiation that are currently in progress.
Some problem areas: woman often have two jobs, unemployment is higher among women, childcare ha deteriorated, there are too few woman in decision-making positions, violence against woman is on the increase in many candidate country and several candidate country are at the centre of the increasing trade in women.
What can be done?
Rapid membership of the EU will provide economic strength, better condition for woman and greater freedom of choice.
The chapter on equality must be accorded equal importance in the membership negotiations.
There must be no transitional periods.
We must monitor whether the directive on equality is really being incorporated into legislation.
Mainstreaming is very important in the internal policy of the candidate countries, too.
An ombudsman for equality issue should be introduced, and in the candidate country too.
The EU should pursue a campaign to combat violence against woman throughout Eastern and Central Europe.
The EU should also take the initiative and organise a UN convention against the trade in human beings.
I started by talking about my male status.
Perhaps this issue of gender need to be pointed out in this Assembly.
On the basis of my own experience, if I may speak personally, I am convinced that Paragraph 15 of the resolution - stating the importance of men' s involvement in, and access to, good childcare - is the most important paragraph by far if equality and equal condition are to be achieved for men and women.
I should like to conclude by saying that equality begin in the home.
If we cannot share task and responsibility in the small world of the home, there will never be real equality in the big world outside, either.
Mr President, I greatly appreciate the fact that France, during it presidential term, ha decided to issue Parliament with a statement on equality.
This is, of course, no surprise, a we know that Secretary of State Péry is also extremely active in these matter in France.
She is quite right when she say that step taken forward nationally can inspire u at EU level and, on the other hand, step taken forward at EU level can give hint to the Member States regarding the direction they should go in.
It must also be said that France' s constitutional amendment to establish a policy of equal decision-making would perhaps be ideal a a source of inspiration not just in the Member States, but perhaps also at European Union level.
I know that in this we are getting into a very sensitive area a we are stepping into what is almost like the Member States' area of competence.
We could perhaps say that a the Commission ha begun to ensure there is equal representation of men and woman in it own committee and expert group it will perhaps not be such a very big step from there to what Mrs Dybkjær said, dare we say it, that we should work on the assumption that both woman and men should represent the European Union at a higher level too, such a at summit conferences.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment in this area with regard to the Charter on Fundamental Rights, a far a I am concerned, is that the Charter doe not say that we should carry through the idea of equal representation of woman and men in decision-making.
However, this should have been incorporated in the Charter quite naturally - in a modern society such a ours - but this work will certainly have to be continued and gone into in greater detail.
Péry spoke of the importance of reconciling work with family life.
I am glad that she also mentioned that the method chosen by Finland wa being used in France, in which quite clear indicator are identified to gauge the situation.
This will also perhaps serve a an answer for Mrs Swiebel, who wa demanding that we must be able to define clear target and that result must be able to be measured.
I believe that this method, which Finland ha introduced for the first time, work well in many area and while it is part of the Commission' s strategy on equality there is good reason to expect much from it.
I would also like to mention one problem in the area of work and family life.
It would appear that it is getting harder for young family to take advantage of the right that have been guaranteed them by law, a competition in the job market ha become so fierce.
We must be very careful that young mother and father do not freely surrender their right because they are afraid of the problem they might encounter in working life.
Reference wa also made here several time to mainstreaming, and I can only agree with what ha been said here that, for example, in the area of economic policy it is of absolutely major importance to start considering the gender perspective.
The fact is, in Denmark, woman suspect that the whole European integration project threatens the right and level of welfare woman have achieved there.
This, I think, present quite a challenge for both the Commission and the Council.
Minister, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the two report being debated today: Mrs Dybkjær' s report on progress so far, and Mrs Eriksson' s on the future. I found them both enormously interesting.
Today, I simply want to talk specifically about what these report contain - our current objective a Europeans in term of equal opportunities.
What emerges from these report is that it is difficult to move from theory to practice.
Plenty of theory, plenty of fine words. No one is quicker than u to say these thing or to come out with fine words, but practical result are a long time coming.
Why doe this worry me?
Because I think there is currently great ambiguity and awkwardness about equal opportunity in Europe.
We want specific action and we want mainstreaming.
The two thing are not easily reconciled and we could lose out on both counts.
For example, at noon we will be voting on two report on discrimination and equal access to employment which both exclude gender on the ground that gender is covered by policy other than discrimination policy.
I find that position awkward and ambiguous, and I think that mean more thought is required on the draft you are presenting to us, because there is no certainty that all this will produce practical results.
To take a very simple example, which we were just discussing three day ago in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, are we talking about defending flexibility or about fighting poverty?
Both are possible, but they are also contradictory, because we know very well that flexibility creates more poverty, and next week' s World March of Women will make that point.
So there are contradiction in our equal opportunity policy and I think we must be aware of that so that we can organise the future of our project better, or so it seems to me.
Another example, also full of contradiction, is part-time work.
It appears in today' s report amongst the social rights.
Is access to part-time work a social right?
I have no idea, but I doubt it.
On the other hand, there is also something in the report which seems to me very important and which Mrs Dybkjær ha placed well to the fore, a ha Mrs Eriksson: the fact that in future we need to be concerned about so-called 'derived rights' , that is, women' s social right to autonomy.
What happens to a woman who ha spent twenty year with a husband who then leaf her?
What sort of pension will she get?
Good question!
What is her tax position?
There is no equal opportunity, there is no real equality for woman without autonomy and freedom a social rights, so that they can have control of their life throughout their lives.
I would like this subject, so strongly emphasised in our reports, to be one of our priority from now on.
I now want to talk about enlargement, which is still, perhaps, one of my concerns. We are delighted that the Finnish Presidency ha introduced indicator and I know the French Presidency want to consolidate this indicator policy into an important institution.
I am very pleased about that, I am delighted.
But looking at the problem of enlargement, and here I will conclude, because the issue of enlargement worry me a great deal, yesterday we naturally voted in favour of the report on enlargement to a whole series of countries.
But where, pray, are the condition for women' s right and equal opportunity in that enlargement?
I am concerned about that and I urge the French Presidency to be concerned about it.
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, all of u here agree that equal opportunity for men and woman must be pursued in all our policies.
But beyond that, the method ha to be defined.
We need to be sure that what is decided in Strasbourg is real progress.
In the name of equal opportunities, and thanks to Europe, French woman have won the right to work at night.
I am not sure they should thank Europe for that.
The European method, imposing uniformity, is wrong.
First, because while women, like citizen in general, have the same idea of what is fair and what is unjust, they do not have the same idea about their role in the various culture of the European Union.
Nature ha determined that woman should carry the future of humanity in her womb.
Now, the primary duty of any society is to promote life and hence do everything possible to enable woman to reconcile their legitimate right to personal and professional development with potential motherhood.
In that area, there is no equality.
Only woman can have children.
So fairness doe not come into the equation when the role of woman and men are a different a that.
Rather than making abortion easier, the French government should be developing a policy aimed at eliminating every material and social reason which might drive a woman to such a negation of life.
Every abortion is a condemnation of our society, but never a condemnation of an individual woman.
Since I became a Member of this Parliament, however, it ha been my impression that a part of this House would rather forget this aspect of women' s lives.
More serious still, I also have the feeling that the institution of the European Union have the greatest difficulty developing a global vision of society in our countries.
As the debate and regulation go by, a compartmentalised vision of our society appears.
Instead of addressing everyone, we compartmentalise: minority after minority, ethnic group after ethnic group.
As a French woman and citizen, this vision of the world is particularly alien to me.
I am a citizen who should enjoy the same right and the same prospect a any citizen of the other sex, no more and no less.
I do smile sometimes in this House, particularly when I hear that the group most hostile to the single currency are women, especially in Denmark.
When we decide on policy targeting people with disabilities, or blind people, it is perfectly normal to add women.
It is really very annoying that these women, from the depth of their kitchen or household accounts, are rejecting the radiant future of the euro.
They must be re-educated.
The image of the European woman we find in the page of our report and directive doe not correspond to that of these Danish women, the majority of whom are saying no to the euro.
So, new page describe her a ill informed, isolated, and out of step with everyone else.
Danish woman will appreciate that.
I take this opportunity to salute the Danish woman Members of Parliament, especially Ulla Sandbaek and Pia Kjaersgaard. They come from different political backgrounds, but together they embody the courage so many men lack.
It is my conviction that a method is being outlined today through policy geared to sectors, not to say minorities, in this Parliament.
Any kind of national attachment must be destroyed, European society must be reduced to a collection of isolated individual in small ethnic, sexual, social or other minorities, all run from a distance by a European State a distant a it is pernickety.
It is not surprising, therefore, that Mrs Dybkjær' s report refers to the Beijing Platform, which us women' s right a a weapon to defend a particular conception of woman and their rights, and impose it on the whole world.
The Polish delegation to the New York conference already had occasion to appreciate the arrogance of a part of the European delegation incapable of accepting other position more measured than it own.
Other Members of this Parliament had to take up the pen to put thing right, and Poland thanked them for it.
In spite of these remarks, we shall vote for this report because we are naturally in favour of equal opportunities, but what equal opportunity mean most of all is respect for everyone.
Mr President, Mrs Péry, Commissioner, the position of, and relationship between, men and woman in society ha changed dramatically over the past decades.
The number of dual earner household ha grown considerably.
Given this development, we applaud a policy which contributes towards the equivalent development of men and woman in line with their talent and interests.
The present report, however, put forward an exaggerated interpretation of the principle of equality.
The diversity or difference with regard to men and woman are still not being given enough consideration.
There is also the freedom of the individual to consider.
As a result, the freedom of choice for women, which they strive for, can very easily fuel frustration and renewed form of repression.
I therefore find it telling that the report is seeking to establish a numerical balance between men and woman across all sector of society, for example in the labour market.
The choice of training and profession for men and woman will depend on their own personalities, talent and interests.
To respect and value these difference show that we still have our foot firmly on the ground.
The campaign launched by the Dutch government to encourage girl to select more exact science subject and so-called male professions, have failed miserably.
A European repeat of these debacle appears completely pointless to me.
I just have to get something off my chest. I find it shocking that the representative of the Council should mention the fact that equality should be enforced, yes enforced, would you believe, in the home.
I do hope that she share my view that the government ha no right to intervene in the private sphere.
In addition, the report undervalues transductive labour.
Bringing up children, especially transferring standard and values, is of vital importance to our society.
Whoever denies mother the freedom of choice to bring up their own child unpaid, will be presented with the bill later on in the form of youth crime and vandalism.
The idea that woman lag behind in paid work compared to men should certainly not be considered a inequality, because it is based on a one-sided, woman-unfriendly vision.
After all, it is the cool, rational, enlightened thinking which advance human being a independent, autonomous creature and downgrade woman to being the second sex.
When one adopts this thinking a starting point, it is easy to see why one could be in favour of women' s equality.
This choice, however, doe not offer any guarantee against evil, suffering or injustice.
At best, it sustains other type of suppression.
Human being are independent and responsible creature placed in relation to God, their Creator, on the one hand and their fellow human being on the other.
This means, among other things, that men and woman interrelate and need each other in order to do themselves justice a men and women.
This is exactly why keeping marriage and family completely out of the picture in this report represents a lost opportunity.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, it wa certainly a sensible initiative on the part of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities to compile a report on the Commission' s annual report concerning equal opportunity for men and woman in the European Union, covering the period from 1997 to 1999.
These report have confirmed what we were all already fully aware of. The situation is far from hunky-dory when it come to equal treatment and equal opportunity for men and woman within the EU, despite the fact that the first equal treatment directive concerning equal pay for men and woman came into force a long a 25 year ago, and Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, which came into force in 1957, made provision for the elimination of wage discrimination against women.
That wa over 40 year ago.
After all, we are already discussing the Fifth Action Programme on the equal treatment of men and women.
Mrs Dybkjær' s report contains another long list of demand and wish directed at the Commission, particularly in respect of inquiries, which I do not, however, necessarily consider to be indispensable.
But we all know only too well where the real problem lie, and that the lack of political will - particularly in the Member States - the lack of willingness on the part of the social partners, the hesitancy of the political party when it come to involving more woman in the decision-making processes, and also -let u be honest about this - the mentality of many men and women, are responsible for this unsatisfactory state of affairs.
Once again, we have been left in no doubt on that score.
What I do not see in this report, Commissioner, are call for the Commission to at last get round to following up Parliament' s very specific proposals.
We have a far more pressing need for concrete legislative proposal from the Commission, than we do for study and fine declaration and speeches.
Firstly, improvement are called for in the existing directives, for example those covering equality of opportunity in the sphere of social security, with respect to public and company schemes.
I would remind you, in this connection, of our report on the splitting of pension right in the event of divorce, a a result of which, payment for surviving relative and the retirement age are to be included in the 1979 directive.
I would put you in mind of the overdue improvement made to the 'caffeine-free' free directive of 1986 concerning equal right for self-employed people, including spouse that help out - those million of invisible workers, most of whom are woman - and whom are engaged in small and medium-sized agricultural enterprise without any form of social security.
Five year ago, we unanimously adopted an excellent report on this subject, one of our demand being a framework statute for spouse that help out in the family business.
There were two session of round-table talk organised by the Commission, and we have not heard another word since.
That wa three year ago.
What we really need is for the Commission to at last come up with concrete, legislative proposals, instead of frittering away time and money on report and inquiries, and wasting time that would be better spent on worthwhile legislative work.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities would also do well to take this advice to heart.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Nicole Péry for giving u high hope of the French Presidency, which ha made great stride with it law on equality.
Electoral list comprising 50% men and 50% woman could be worth emulating.
However, we are still awaiting the decision regarding a formal Council of Ministers.
Unfortunately, we are only ever referred to other Councils of Ministers for a decision.
We do not want to wait any longer.
Other speaker have made the point: we want political action.
It is high time for decision on equal pay for equal work, i.e. for Articles 141 and 13 to be implemented.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights ha to be more than a fine proclamation.
What we need are concrete implementation measure that will enable people to reconcile a career with family life.
The Fifth Action Programme will assist u in this, but we a a European Parliament have already come some way ourselves.
We have created a network of committee on equality with our female counterpart in the national parliaments, and in November, we will be meeting our female counterpart from the Member States, a well a those from the candidate countries.
We did the same thing, incidentally, in New York, at the Beijing + 5 Conference.
I wa the rapporteur in Peking and the co-rapporteur in New York.
The Polish woman were very grateful to u for making it clear that the representative who wa there at the time most definitely did not reflect the view of Polish women.
I met with some very positive response there.
I would like to remind our President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, of the important speech he made here.
There must be no glass ceiling in the European edifice.
The European Parliament employ 30% women, which is the highest percentage rate of all the institutions.
The Commission ha 25% women, so at least there is an upward trend.
The European Court of Justice could do better, a only two of it fifteen judge are women.
Yes, and the picture look very gloomy in the Council on the equal opportunity policy front.
All I can say there, is that the Council is what you might call a developing country where equality for woman is concerned.
We have every reason to be concerned.
We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality.
That give u great cause for concern, and we expect that a well a stepping up the pace in matter of equal opportunity policy, there will also be concrete measures.
Mr President, the Commission report on equal opportunity are very welcome, but unfortunately, a the rapporteur said earlier, in a practical sense they are not very useful a real measure of success or base on which to build future programmes, because they are too descriptive and there is not enough analysis of success and failures.
One of the vital requirement for improvement in the position of woman is firstly to know exactly what the current situation is.
That mean we need accurate fact and figures.
Then the evaluation report can use clear criterion and give u an objective analysis of progress or the lack of progress.
After all, one of the main criticism that I receive from grassroots women's organisation is that when applying for financial support from the European Union, they have to make very detailed prediction about their future work and it outcome.
Yet in report like this, we do not have anything like the same detailed information.
We need to ensure that information and activity reach woman in their own communities, and one effective way of doing that would be by developing and promoting real life case study which reflect a positive image.
I try to look at these report from the point of view of woman in Wales, the constituency I represent, and consider how they are affected by this kind of progress and how they can get access to and use this kind of information.
I would support the request of the Committee on Women's Rights in this report for a major study of woman in the EU and in the candidate country a a starting point for future work.
A lot is being done by women's organisations, by governments, by the European Parliament and the Commission.
We have heard from the Minister of the progress that ha been made in France and we can learn a lot from this.
Greater involvement by woman at all level of government and in all area of life is essential for deepening democracy and achieving and maintaining peace.
We should be encouraging better dialogue with woman everywhere - after all the European Union is seen a a pioneer in term of equality legislation.
The report are welcome and the progress they outline is a step forward, but until we really begin to exchange good practice and base our work on real statistics, we are not in a position to judge whether we are on the right road to achieving real equality between woman and men.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Péry, lady and gentlemen, a the Commission' s report acknowledge, major issue still remain to be resolved in the field of equal opportunity for men and women.
In practically every sphere of activity, serious inequality still exist.
Despite the differing situation in Member States, there are generally fewer woman in the labour market, they are most affected by unemployment, including long-term unemployment, and by casual labour, part-time work and atypical, insecure and badly paid work.
Women' s average salary are still lower than men' s, by around 28% on average, which is a contributory factor to woman making up the bulk of the poor and to preventing them from participating in social and political life.
Since we know that quality employment that provides right is a fundamental factor in guaranteeing equality between men and woman and in guaranteeing woman the same kind of independence a men, it is crucial that we study the cause of this situation and adopt the necessary measure to overcome it, specifically through policy on employment, training, education and on infrastructure for supporting the family and children, giving priority to this issue at a practical level and not just making declaration of intent.
With regard to participation in the decision-making process, either at political level, in the business world or in the trade union movement, woman are still in the minority.
Whilst this situation can be explained to some extent by the difficulty woman face in the labour market and within the family, it is also true that political party must shoulder their democratic responsibility to guarantee equal opportunity for woman to participate in political life and in the decision-making process itself, in order to put an end to the scandalous situation that still exists at the beginning of the new millennium.
Madam President-in-Office, thank you for coming here today to tell u about the French Presidency' s interesting initiatives.
I should like to dwell in particular on two terms: articulation between family and work and parité au quotidien.
These concept and what they stand for are gaining ground in French society and I hope that this interest will be exported to the rest of Europe.
I also wanted to congratulate you on your initiative in introducing the female dimension into the Councils because, a we see on a daily basis, women' s issue are special issues, not just a necessary dimension to every policy.
As far a the Commission report are concerned, Commissioner, we received them with interest and we examined them in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities. However, I have to say that we were dissatisfied with the descriptive nature of the report and trust that future report which come under your responsibility will contain a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results.
On other words, we need a breakdown of the indicator applied, detailed statistic comparing the situation in the Member States, an analysis of cultural difference in the various European society and an indication of the factor which act a disincentive to the development we are seeking and to the development of a European nationality for woman which, a we can see on a daily basis, for example from the recent referendum in Denmark, is a sector which we need to address.
My final comment concern the situation of woman in the country preparing to join the European Union.
Because of the course of our own history and our experience from the policy which we have applied, we have an obligation to help them and I therefore feel that the Commission and the Council should call on the Member States to adopt the mechanism which allow equality to be applied to all their policies.
We have both a political and a moral responsibility for these country trying to find their way into Europe and for the cohesion of the enlarged Europe which we are preparing.
Mr President, welcome back to Parliament, Mrs Péry.
Thank you for your considerable commitment and for the work you have made a point of doing in the interest of equality.
We are especially looking forward to your succeeding in implementing a policy of alternate listing of woman and men in decision-making.
That is really excellent.
I would just like to raise a couple of issue which I believe should, a a matter of urgency, be a part too of the Council' s thinking and of the work it is doing.
It concern not only woman in the European Union, but also woman in the candidate countries.
In the candidate countries, the social exclusion of woman ha been substantially greater than that of men. It is therefore woman who have been hardest hit.
Many of them have lost their job and, with this, come violence against women, sex discrimination and the trade in women.
Many woman are lured to Western Europe with promise of a better life, but the reality is the opposite.
They often fall victim to act of violence and some are forced into prostitution.
Consequently we must demand and support preventive programme and specific measures, such a strict legislation, witness protection scheme and information campaigns.
However, the fact that the existing law are not enforced and new one are not created mean that the government of Europe are indirectly allowing the Mafia to continue with it activities.
This is therefore an incredibly important issue for u to get to grip with.
In this area therefore, the Council, especially it men, ha a tremendously important job to do in leading Europe in the fight against the Mafia that trade in women, for this slave trade is not something that responsible politician can push aside, shrug off or ignore.
We have a political responsibility to abolish this slavery of modern times.
In conclusion, I would like to say something about the men - and it is the men that I address.
When I talk about 'the men' , I mean the men with power.
It is Prodi, Chirac, Jospin, Schröder, Blair, Persson and the others who must become involved in this, namely all 15 of our head of government.
Mr President, the recital of this report highlight aspect of gender inequality.
Women are forced into temporary work, they are far more exposed to insecure job and unemployment, and on average they are paid 30% le than men.
Unfortunately, the proposal that follow do not measure up to the challenge of those recitals.
Firstly, because the majority of them are about creating monitoring centres, collecting statistic and carrying out studies.
Gender inequality is not exactly a new phenomenon we are just discovering, needing to be studied.
As regard work, we cannot seek equality and continue to develop insecurity, flexibility and part-time work.
That is part-time work that woman are forced into, because 70% of them would like to work full-time.
Today we are witnessing the pauperisation of wage-earning woman all over Europe, including France, where 15% of them live on le than FRF 3 650 a month.
Worse, so-called equality is sometimes turned against women: for instance, in France today the incorporation of a directive is going to make night work legal for women.
A strange notion of equality.
Other choice could have been made; night work for men could have been banned instead, when it is not required to meet society' s needs.
In conclusion, fine word and nothing concrete.
That will not be enough.
That is what we will be saying in Brussels on 14 October with the World March of Women fighting against violence and for real work for all.
Those are the essential condition for real equality.
Mr President, I would like to thank both Mrs Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for being here today.
From the report and speech that we are considering today we can deduce, a many of u already knew, that the problem of equal opportunity is a structural problem and that in order to deal with it we need global strategies, because a woman we are not a category or a homogenous social group or indeed any sort of group.
In the European Union we are currently running the risk of our debate being elitist and of the progress only reaching some of the more informed and more privileged women, leaving behind the rest, who are young women, immigrant women, single mothers, victim of the white slave trade, etc. They suffer from multiple discrimination.
We cannot continue with an elitist debate, we cannot continue to have progress only benefiting those woman who enjoy greater opportunities.
Our effort need to be directed at the woman who have the most problems, who are certainly the majority in the European Union.
We therefore need to ass the real situation of women, we need to draw up indicator and we need to make our political action binding, so that progress really reach everyone and not just a few.
Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate the French Presidency on initiating this debate. I should also particularly like to congratulate our former Vice-President, who is fully aware of the problem we face in this House and of the great interest that the European Parliament take in the debate on issue of equality between men and women.
As the Minister quite rightly said, we are discussing a political issue of the greatest importance and it is crucial that Europe understands that we are arguing that equality is just such an issue.
I should also like to congratulate Mrs Péry, a a French politician, on the coherence shown in her own country, which amended it constitution to include equality between men and women. It also then succeeded in introducing and approving a law to implement this.
Not all country have managed to follow France' s example, which I hope will bear fruit elsewhere.
I should like to say, Mrs Péry that I consider the fact that you are organising a Council of Ministers for Women' s Affairs and that every government in the European Union ha one member responsible for equal opportunity issue to be of the utmost importance.
This is the only way in which 'mainstreaming' can be introduced across the board in government and in which the equal opportunity policy will gain the high profile necessary to give it substance.
I shall end, Mrs Péry, by asking you a question.
As the Ministry of Equal Opportunities in Portugal is now defunct, who will represent my country at the meeting on 27 October in Paris?
Mr President, I too would like to thank Minister Péry and Commissioner Diamantopoulou for today's debate. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, whose report not only contains observation on the situation of equal opportunity in the European Union, but also recommends a course of action.
I would particularly like to thank the Minister for the work she is doing in her own country and a President-in-Office of the Council, and I would like to make a connection between the work of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the work of the Commission, focusing on one point: employment.
The report before u is, I feel, a major synergistic work. The guideline for 2001 on equal opportunity in the world of employment are starting to become better defined, more specific and more effective.
This is the way forward.
The Committee on Women's Rights would like to congratulate the Commission and also propose a few even more specific pointers.
I truly believe that this report and the Fifth Action Programme which lay down a strategy are the way forward.
We might do better to stop complaining, or rather to complain but, at the same time, to show due appreciation for the positive step which are being taken to ensure that we make increasingly effective progress.
Mr President, I will not reply individually, except to Mrs Torres Marques, because her question is really direct and personal.
I wa indeed sorry to see that Maria De Belém Roseira wa no longer the representative.
She wa very active during the Portuguese Presidency, but it is not up to me to make that decision, it is up to the Minister for Employment, whom we have invited to the conference on gender equality.
I will now respond generally on the issues, rather than give individual answer to any one of you.
Several of you have said gender equality policy did not start a year, two years, or three year ago.
Obviously not, and a someone involved with association for social change - because I too, like many of you, have some thirty year of involvement with these association behind me - I know how hard the social movement, the feminist movement and the intellectual movement, naturally, have worked to move this issue forward, and today we take our place in role of responsibility in our institutions.
The history of the women' s movement go back way over fifty years: I sometimes remember Olympe de Gouges, who dared to call for a declaration of women' s right and gender equality, and wa condemned to the scaffold in 1793.
Of course the history of feminism is very long.
My second comment is about inequality in the world of work.
Ladies and gentlemen, political will is clearly not enough to eliminate every possible social inequality overnight, especially in the world of work.
Management, the union and the market have a role to play, but we do what we can by expressing a political will.
I can tell you in one sentence what I am doing about it: I have wasted no time proposing a law to improve equality in the world of work.
This is currently being debated in Parliament, and I have introduced a provision, which obviously doe not suit everyone in my country, but which is compulsory and will compel each company or profession to negotiate on equality in the workplace every three years, covering salaries, condition of work, career prospects, and access to lifelong training.
My third comment is about your doubts: plenty of speeches, plenty of documents, plenty of reports, but not enough actual progress towards quantified targets.
It is true that the reality in the European Union is that we have to take decision a Fifteen and we differ culturally in relation to these issues.
Nevertheless, I believe in the need to fight for quantified targets, and to implement policy through indicators.
I did not mention this in my speech, but I am fully intending to propose a feasibility study on the gender institution to the Ministerial Conference, because we need an instrument for monitoring those indicators, and for exchange of good practice.
Fourth point: the issue of the future.
Two of you mentioned new social rights, new fiscal rights.
I can tell you that will be the central theme of the Swedish Presidency, and I shall be following it with great interest, because the progress made will certainly inspire French action.
Fifth point: the Charter.
It is true that while much ha been done compared with the initial stage of this document, we might have hoped for something more dynamic on decision-making.
I have not lost hope, however, of improving the text.
Sixth point: enlargement.
In New York I took the liberty of making myself clear on that issue on behalf of my country.
I shall be just a clear today, on behalf of the Presidency.
The candidate really must be helped to come up to the level of the acquis communautaire.
That seems clear.
Excluding gender equality from the acquis communautaire is unimaginable, and of course we shall be just a vigilant on that issue a on the others.
Finally, violence, prostitution, the grip of the Mafia. If Mrs Diamantopoulou want to take a European initiative, because we have done thing before at Community level to combat violence, I shall be there to support her.
Mr President, what we refer to here and what ha been referred to for a century a the women' s problem is approached from two different angles, a the debate here in the House today ha demonstrated.
The first reason that the structure of the social and economic system is to blame for present inequality and the policy of the European Union and of all the national government is based on this reasoning.
The second approach say that women, themselves, are to blame for the inequality which exists in society.
This reasoning often lead to absurd distortions, one of which wa heard here today, i.e. that the way in which woman voted in Denmark wa determined by some particular female chromosome and not by the social difference which they experience on a daily basis.
Honourable Members, Mrs Péry, the President-in-Office, ha given u a superb analysis of the priority of the French Presidency, which we all believe will be particularly important priorities.
I should like in my brief intervention to confine myself to the report.
The 97, 98 and 99 report are not simply working papers.
They are political tools.
I should like to remind the House that the Commission' s legislative proposal due for debate call for annual report from the Member States on the subject of positive action because we really do believe that these report are political tool for three reasons.
Firstly, they give u a picture of the situation.
As you will have seen, the report contain analytical tables, data on each Member State and table on all the individual sectors.
Secondly, because they allow u to make a comparative assessment of the Member States and a comparative assessment of the overall progress of the European Union over time.
Thirdly, because they form the basis for strategy, both for the European Union - even in the Charter of Fundamental Rights the fact that we had a picture of the current situation played an important role - and at national level, given that the Member States are able to use the comparative assessment to set national targets.
In my view, the report which you have at your disposal concentrate on and highlight three issues. The first is the participation of woman in decision-making.
The average participation of woman is 18.6% in Europe, 28.9% in regional parliament and 30% in Parliament and there appears to be a very minor increase in the order of 0.6% from one year to the next.
The second interesting comment concern the wage differential between men and woman which, at European level, is hovering at the unacceptable level of 23% to 24% and, in some region of Europe, is a high a 40%.
The third interesting statistic concern domestic violence, the violence which woman suffer at European level.
I fully accept the comment in the report and the recommendation by Members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report.
I have taken your comment on board and I see that we need to concentrate on analysing data, especially the result of successful strategy and successful initiative at national and European level, in order to give the report a strategic slant.
However, I need your help here.
My service face huge problem collecting data from national governments.
There are several countries, although one could cite example for all countries, where it is impossible for u to collect statistics, where it is impossible for u to collect their experience and result at national level from innovative policy in time.
I believe that, if you work together with your national governments, you can help the Commission to collate this data quickly, so that it in turn can present an analysis of them in the sort of report which you require.
Finally, a far a enlargement is concerned, it is of course, a Mrs Péry ha said, a question of acquis communautaire.
However, I would stress that, in working with each of the candidate countries, we have been closely monitoring the question of sexual equality, a regard both the legislative framework and the creation of institution which can support the application of these policies.
As you know, we have starting signing joint report with each candidate country in order to monitor their adjustment to employment policy on an annual basis.
They contain an entire chapter devoted to the participation of women.
I should like, once again, to thank Mrs Dybkjær for the excellent, in-depth work contained in her report, which will be most useful to u in our next report, and I should like especially to thank the French Presidency and Mrs Péry for being so pro-active on the issue of equality during their presidency.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Community custom code
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0254/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (6995/2000 - C5-0267/2000 - 1998/0134(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi).
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning we will approve the Council common position definitively adopting this reform of the Community Customs Code.
It could be thought, given that Parliament ha not tabled amendment to the Council common position, that we have before u a perfect text.
That is not the case, but it is a satisfactory text and, having given it great thought and following an extensive debate, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market decided not to table any amendments.
What are the reason for this?
We need a little history.
The reform of the Community Customs Code wa enshrined in Article 253 of the current code and a reform wa planned for before 1 January 1998.
We are therefore somewhat behind schedule.
This reform is important because it aim to re-examine the Community Customs Code in accordance with the progress of the internal market and of administrative techniques.
It is therefore an important and urgent reform in a sector that, a we are all well aware, is the real core of European construction.
Building a common custom system ha been one of the major achievement in that progress towards European construction.
The proposal aim to simplify custom process by mean of computerised or paperless declarations, to make the rule more flexible, to improve the procedure for collecting duty and to provide a more solid basis for applying the principle of good faith to import that are subject to the preferential regime, establishing legal instrument that enable u to combat fraud and offering greater legal security.
At first reading, in the Paasilinna report, Parliament adopted thirteen amendment of varying importance, which also met a variety of fate when they subsequently went to the Council.
In it joint position that wa definitively and unanimously adopted, the Council incorporated eight amendment and rejected five.
I am not going to comment on the eight amendment that were adopted, a we are all in agreement with them.
I am going to discus the five amendment that were not incorporated.
Three of them - Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 7, referred to the commitology procedure.
These amendment need to be considered in the new context of the interinstitutional agreement, and therefore, Parliament can agree to not insisting on these commitology amendment given that they have been superseded to a certain extent by the new interinstitutional framework.
With Amendment No 15, Parliament wished to introduce a recital urging the custom authority to apply custom rule correctly, to establish monitoring measure in order to ensure that it wa applied consistently and to facilitate action against fraud.
The Council considered that it wa not drafted suitably in order to be included in the Community Customs Code and pointed out that there is a Green Paper - which is currently being converted into rule - specifically for combating fraud.
We were therefore also able to accept this amendment not being incorporated.
Finally, Amendment No 11 requested that this modification to the Community Customs Code enter into force before 1 January 2000 and is, therefore, no longer valid.
Aside from these amendments, it should be considered that the common position modified the original text on which Parliament had agreed on two important points: the first is Article 220, in which the Commission aimed to maintain a longer period for conducting the investigation that could lead to a prosecution for fraud or a wrongful declaration.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, following a long debate, considered that it wa not reasonable to maintain legal uncertainty for a period of six years, and that three years, which is the period set, is a more reasonable period of time for establishing, with the appropriate mean and the average proceedings, whether or not there were irregularity in a declaration.
With regard to the modification of Paragraph 6 of Article 215, it should be said that we are dealing with a deeper issue, because the intention is that the additional declaration could be made anywhere in the European Union, especially wherever in the European Union the undertaking in question ha it headquarters.
On this point we consider that, given administrative and technical advances, instead of making an amendment on the legislative text, we preferred an amendment to the draft resolution that I hope the Commission will be able to accept. In a subsequent reform of the Community Customs Code, this will enable this idea to be incorporated, which is one that we feel is important and deserves to be promoted and supported by the European Parliament.
Mr President, in the increasingly open economic climate in which the European Union must operate, and given the need to establish trade relation that ensure the competitiveness of undertakings, it is crucial that we establish a legal framework that set the same rule of play for everyone.
In this sense, the Community Customs Code is an essential support for the European Union' s trade policy, a well, a we are already aware, a being an essential instrument for protecting the Union' s financial interests.
The progress made on the internal market, the gradual growth in trade due to the increasing opening up of the market and the progress of the information society mean that the Community Customs Code need to be brought up to date with the development of Community and international trade.
Hence the need for and the timeliness of the reform that wa proposed at the time with the aim of simplifying and rationalising custom procedures, precisely in response to the demand of the new reality that I have mentioned.
On the other hand, it wa also necessary, a I understood it, to establish effective monitoring measure to ensure the uniform application of custom procedure across the whole of the Community and to prevent unfair competition and the opening up of loophole that could facilitate fraud.
At the time Parliament therefore introduced some amendment with the aim, on the one hand, of guaranteeing the possibility of conducting custom procedure by mean of computerised declarations, but without this unwittingly opening up the back door to fraud. On the other hand, the aim wa to ensure that custom rule were applied correctly and consistently across the whole of the Community, in order to prevent situation of unfair competition.
As the rapporteur pointed out, however, neither the Council nor the Commission adopted the specific amendment that I have mentioned, because, among other reasons, they considered that they did not add anything to the proposed text and that fraud should be combated outside the Community Customs Code.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, a the rapporteur pointed out, accepted that approach, and therefore decided not to re-introduce the amendments.
I personally continue to believe, however, that the text that wa adopted by Parliament at the time responded much better to the new reality that had arisen from the internal market and the liberalisation of the markets, insofar a the element of clarification and monitoring that were introduced by the amendment that were not adopted were a better guarantee that the rule would be complied with and that the same procedure would be followed when applying them.
I must therefore regret that they were not taken into consideration, although I also understand the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - the position of the rapporteur - of not re-introducing the amendment because, ultimately, what really matter is that the Community Customs Code and the proposed reform move forward and that the legal framework is established.
Let u hope that in the future we will at least be able to achieve those guarantees.
Mr President, I believe that both the rapporteur and Mrs Ferrer have highlighted the main point of Parliament' s position and the legislative procedure to date, and they have pointed out how the Council, Parliament and the Commission have worked together in order to arrive at a text that is correct and acceptable to everyone.
I think that, once again, the conciliation procedure, which mean agreement between the institutions, is working properly.
However, there is an amendment that the Council rightly rejected.
It is Amendment No 15, on fraud.
A Customs Code is not the place for establishing rule on fraud.
That is something that depends on the correct functioning of administration and, clearly, in a legislative debate we should not be discussing the subject of fraud.
Taking advantage of the fact that the Commissioner responsible for the internal market, Mr Bolkestein, is here, I would like to point out that a few year ago the European Parliament established it first committee of inquiry, which wa to investigate fraud in the transport of goods.
There wa a report by Mr Bouwman, an excellent report that we adopted, in which considerable fraud wa revealed, for example, in the case of tobacco.
There were goods, particularly tobacco, which were entering through a non-Community country in the European Economic Area zone, going through the Community zone and then mysteriously leaving the Community zone on paper, but without actually leaving.
Currently, for example, there ha been a drop in the price of banana in the European Union.
It seems that multinational company are placing their excess bananas, those that they do not sell in the United States and Europe, in Eastern Europe. From Eastern Europe, certain 'charitable' organisations, that is mafias, introduce these bananas, which were practically given to them, into the Community market, competing with the price of legal importer and Community producers.
We could also mention the ongoing fraud in tomatoes, in which we see price being continually undervalued because good are being introduced through certain Community port without authorisation.
Therefore, while recognising, a the Council and the Commission have said, that this amendment wa not appropriate in this case, I would like to, once again, take the opportunity to point out that the procedure for monitoring import in the European Union are not working, that fraud is being committed and that this fraud is not only bad for Community taxpayers, but also for the functioning of the internal market, and even for loyalty to third countries.
If we want third country to accept commitments, the European Community must be the most zealous in ensuring that it own rule are being complied with, because if a country ha the opportunity to place product in the Community by mean of smuggling, why is it going to bother to negotiate with u for any sort of concessions?
I therefore welcome the fact that we have reached an agreement on this subject.
I think that the modification are very positive, but I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission for greater vigilance and for stricter measure on fraud in Community customs.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, although it is true that the text is flawed, a the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the rapporteur have already underlined, I would still venture to suggest that this legislative resolution is an example of transparent, simplified and efficient Community legislation.
After all, in the Community Customs Code, a successful attempt ha been made to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner, which surely must always be the objective.
I can only applaud the Customs Code, and I am, therefore, somewhat more positive than Mrs Ferrer, for example, for it indeed form the basis of various area of Community policy within the framework of Community action of the national custom authorities.
The goal to achieve simplified yet quality communication whilst building in a sufficient level of flexibility with regard to the basic rules, thus improving the procedure for collecting duty and offering a higher degree of adjustment of the provision with regard to offering good at customs, meet one of the requirement of the single market, and that ha been achieved in this case, so much so, in fact, that many country have drawn on this model in order to speed up the process to be able to take part in international trade.
In broader terms, the Community Customs Code is one of the most important legal instrument for establishing the amount of outstanding duty and to establish to whom these are due.
The code form the legal basis for levying these duty and, a such, one of the key instrument for protecting the financial interest of the Community and for ensuring the smooth running of the Community policy in different areas.
In short, I believe I can safely say that the administration now ha all the possible lever at it disposal in order to fulfil it task efficiently and within the timeframe provided, and I assume that the European Parliament can invite the administration to make the result of this legislative resolution felt a soon a possible.
Mr President, I would like to ask the Commission to adopt a position on the request made in the legislative resolution for the appropriate measure to be taken in order for there to be a modification of the Community Customs Code, a mentioned by Mr Beysen and a I have also expressed.
Mr President, may I start by extending a warm thanks to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the work it ha carried out on the basis of Mrs Palacio' s report This report encompasses all the question which formed the subject of debate at first reading in March of last year.
I welcome the major overture which have been made with regard to this dossier, which ha been the subject of long and intense discussion within the Council.
I am pleased to note that it wa possible to dismiss the reservation expressed by Parliament due to issue of comitology with regard to various proposals.
This open the door to a major reform of economic custom systems, on which, in fact, Parliament will be informed in detail in the next couple of month prior to approval.
In the same way, the amendment tabled by Parliament regarding paperless declarations, adopted by the Council, will enable Member State custom authority to have state-of-the-art automated administration equipment at their disposal.
Thanks to the initiative taken by Parliament at first reading, the most wished-for outcome within economic circle wa the compromise of good faith, a a result of which it will be possible to strike a better balance between the operators' need for legal certainty and the need for efficient protection of the financial interest of the Community.
That ha been, a is known, the outcome of a long debate in the Council, during which debate the Commission staunchly defended it view.
It come a no surprise that this point form an integral part of the dossier and that the dossier ha been approved unanimously.
Taking into consideration the delicate position in which the dossier now find itself, I am of the opinion that the outcome of a conciliation procedure, assuming that the debate were extended, would have been quite uncertain.
It is true that the Commission would have wished to take matter one step further.
But it can at the same time validate the result achieved and keep some point of it proposal in reserve, which can then be brought up for discussion again at the appropriate time.
In this spirit, the Commission is able to endorse the positive balance-sheet of this legislative operation.
It would like to thank Parliament and the committee chaired by Mrs Palacio, in particular, for the effort made and interest shown by Parliament and the committee with regard to this dossier.
Finally, in direct response to the question raised by both Mr Beysen and Mrs Palacio, I can confirm, on behalf of the Commission, that we will be only too pleased to meet and carry out that request.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting wa suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12.05 p.m.)
Vote
Mr President, I wanted to speak before you took that vote to explain why I wanted Members to vote against the amendment.
Yesterday the whole position changed with the position the Commission ha taken on the legal base.
But it is too late now because you have just taken the vote and Members voted in favour of it.
We will just have to press on.
I am sorry about that.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Mr President, on that last vote, I would just like to inform the House that the Commission issued a press release yesterday and Commissioner Reding spoke last night to the effect that, a regard the report we have just passed and agreed on mobility for teachers, students, academics, others involved in education, and helping them to move around Europe to study, to work and everything else related to the education field, the Commission will not accept the amendment which ask them to do something to enforce these arrangements.
We have exchanged all the happy word and have asked Member States to take action but the Commission, because of restriction on it budget and reason that it ha given before, is now indicating that is not prepared to follow through to see how the measure are being implemented in the different countries, which to my mind rather neuter the whole report that Parliament spent a long time putting together.
This is also very sad for thousand of student and others involved in education across Europe.
I am sure the Commission and the House will have noted what you said.
Welcome
It give me great pleasure to welcome the President of the International Olympic Committee, Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch.
The 27th Olympiad in Sydney, which ha just ended, wa regarded by everyone a a major success, attracting million of spectator from all over the world.
Mr Samaranch, we know you took up your post a IOC President in 1980, and since then, have introduced many important reforms.
Sport should promote peace and human understanding, and I just want to mention a few important initiative which have been taken under your presidency.
Firstly, the integration of China into the Olympic Games; the institution of the Olympic truce; your insistence on participation in the game by all country in the world, a well a from country in conflict, a recent example of which is the participation of athlete from East Timor; the participation of woman in the Olympic Games and in the different governing body ha strengthened considerably under your presidency; and of course, the fact that the Olympic Games in Sydney were considered to have been drugs-free.
Finally, I would like to mention the launch of the International Olympic Truce Centre in July 2000 in Athens which wa created through a joint initiative of the International Olympic Committee and the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a view to promoting the Olympic ideals.
This centre is symbolically based in Greece where the first Olympics took place and where the next Olympic Games in 2004 will be held.
Mr President, we are delighted to welcome you to the European Parliament and we hope you enjoy your visit.
Vote (continuation)
Mr President, we are just about to start the vote on the Mann report and I want to draw your attention to the fact that there appears to be a translation problem in Amendment No 63 from the TDI Group.
I note there it wa submitted in Italian but in the English language it say that "discrimination which requires men to wear a tie should be outlawed".
This must be a translation problem because I am certain that the TDI Group would not want to trivialise such an important piece of legislation on equal right by introducing such a frivolous and unnecessary amendment.
Perhaps you could get your service to check this.
We will look into that.
Mr President, this is on a mistake in translation too, though not a important a the one just mentioned.
In Amendment No 24, the word 'difficulté injustifiée' in the French version are a mistranslation.
I trust this will not change the way we vote, but the French translation really must be checked.
The word in the English version are the authentic ones.

Explanations of vote- Recommendation for second reading Palacio Vallelersundi (A5-0254/2000)
- (DE) Experience show that the economic operator want to have the option of paying import duty in the place where their headquarters in the Union is located.
We Independents therefore support - above all, in the interest of enabling the Internal Market to function successfully - the demand of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for the Commission to draft a legislative proposal concerning the place in which the custom debt wa incurred.
Report Evans (A5-0255/2000)
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Evans report.
I would like to start by congratulating the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Mantovani, on the substantial amendment he tabled to the Commission communication, a communication which, among other things, relates to the movement of young student and young researcher within the European Community.
I said 'young', and therefore the pensioner and elderly people, whose interest I am trying to protect, should not have to concern themselves with this directive.
But time wait for no man: one day the young people will become old people a well; the young researcher will also grow old and, it is to be hoped, pensioners.
I therefore welcome the amendment which call upon the Commission to treat period of study and research a if the student and researcher were paying social security contributions, a this will increase the pension of student and researchers.
Mr President, in my opinion, Robert J. Evans' s report is very important and I voted in favour of it.
The right of freedom of movement of European citizen is still being violated in many ways.
Students in particular often encounter barrier and difficulty in Member States that should no longer occur under EU legislation.
Studies by the European Commission show that needle red tape is causing problem for student from other EU countries.
Residence permit are granted for just short period of time and it is awkward and costly to renew them.
There are some unfortunate situations.
In Spain student are required to deposit - in a Spanish bank account, note - special sum of money that act a a guarantee in order to rent accommodation.
It is also complicated to arrange for students' family to move.
Recently it came out that certain estate agent handling rented accommodation in London would not accept a foreign, for example, a Finnish, guarantor that ensured the Finnish student' s rent would be paid.
European right of citizenship do not seem to carry much weight in this situation.
This is not the first time I have expressed my view on mobility for student and teachers.
We were already condemning the financial difficulty facing Erasmus student during the last session.
Everyone agrees that this mobility must be encouraged in the name of the free movement of persons, but also and especially because of all the benefit to the young citizen of Europe and hence the European Union.
Unfortunately, in practice, the obstacle are still there.
That is what the Commission proposal deplores and the Evans report confirms.
According to the recommendation, based on Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty, Member States need to be encouraged to adopt measure which will steadily remove the existing difficulties, and the citizen of the Union should be offered a platform of right leading to real mobility.
While this proposal is a step in the right direction it still contains a number of gap which the Evans report remedies.
Thus, it includes researcher within the scope of the recommendation.
I think that this is crucial, given that it importance is constantly emphasised in the context of building a European research area.
Mr Evans also demonstrates that people hoping to benefit from programme in this area need to be better informed about their social security entitlements.
Knowledge of foreign language is accepted a a necessary precursor to mobility.
Remember that 2001 ha been designated European Year of Languages.
It is therefore vital to promote the learning of at least two Community languages, to encourage linguistic and cultural preparation prior to any mobility measure.
Then there are the scandalous tax on renewal of residence permits.
These must be regarded a an obstacle to be eliminated.
The report also stress the need to eliminate obstacle to mobility, be they legal, linguistic, cultural, financial or administrative.
I call on the Member States to coordinate the formality to be fulfilled for enrolling in the establishment of other Member States.
I am especially thinking of deadlines.
To illustrate my point, I need only refer to a case brought to my attention last Friday.
A young man who had passed his Baccalaureat wa refused registration in Belgium, because he had missed the deadline by three days!
It is very difficult for French Baccalaureat candidate to meet a deadline of 15 July when they only receive their result in mid-July, and must then obtain recognition of their qualification - recognition which, in my opinion, cost far too much - not to mention the young people who have to re-sit and who are penalised by a year in some case because of that.
This is just one example among many.
I shall end by mentioning one of my pet subjects, mutual recognition of qualifications.
To avoid repeating myself, I refer you to my earlier speeches.
Mobility inside the European Union is one of the essential condition for enabling European citizen to feel that they are full member of this Europe we are gradually building.
This is more than a symbol; it is a reason, a driving force, for belonging to the European culture and model we are proclaiming.
That is why I shall vote for this report.
It lay down condition to enable people travelling inside the Union to do so free from restriction on their rights, their social security, or other benefits.
This report is all the more important because it come at a critical time for the European Union, a time of enlargement.
Mobility for all, including national of third country legally resident in Union territory and student and teacher acting independently - outside the Socrates and Leonardo programme - is one of the fundamental value of the Union which we must uphold so that the candidate country know exactly what kind of Union they will be joining.
(PT) Despite the fact that the European Union recognises the right of Member States' citizen to freedom of movement, to the provision of service and to residence, there is considerable difference between what the text say and the reality experienced by many people. Examples of this are the disparity in health care cover, the risk of dual taxation, the random nature of social provision, the lack of recognition of professional qualification and the complexity of legal texts, which make it very difficult for the ordinary man or woman to know exactly what their right are.
As the rapporteur said, the Commission appears to be aware that, unless concrete measure are adopted, certain fundamental freedom that are enshrined in the Treaty, such a the right of residence and the right of free movement, are, in practice, in danger of becoming mere statement of principle.
The Commission must therefore adopt ambitious measure to guarantee the right to reside and settle, and, amongst others, the right to work, the right to study and the right to have one' s qualification recognised in Member States other than one' s own.
- (SV) While in principle we adopt a positive view of the European Parliament and the Council' s recommendation on mobility within the Community, we would like to state the following:
We believe that, from the point of view of equality and justice, it is very important that third-country national resident within the EU should have the right to utilise the provision of Community legislation on the same term a the Union' s own citizens.
We also believe that, to a great extent, the Member States themselves should be allowed to decide on the tax to be collected.
Healthy competition will reduce the tax burden on businesses, encouraging entrepreneurship and therefore the creation of job opportunities.
In this way, the states' loss of income due to tax competition may be offset by the fact that more people are paying income tax.
We are therefore opposed to Amendment 38 concerning the introduction of common tax regulation for volunteers.
I strongly endorse this report from my colleague, Robert Evans, designed to boost mobility amongst student and others involved in training across the EU.
He is right to emphasise the need for further action to overcome bureaucratic problem relating to residence right and right to emphasise the need of disadvantaged group such a the disabled.
I support his desire to see research worker included in the proposal and his comment about the importance of involving country preparing to join the EU.
I hope when this report come back for second reading we are able to note that the Council ha incorporated the rapporteur's sensible amendments.
The two-fold approach of education and examination for master craftsman diploma or certificate is prerequisite to future economic success.
Mobility and life-long learning must go hand in hand with assuring a high standard of education for our young student and working people.
Report Cashman (A5-0259/2000)
Mr President, I wa prompted to vote for the Cashman report by the word of the Chairman of the Pensioners' Association of the municipality where I live - Curno, in the district of Bergamo, Italy - who said to me, 'We have absolutely no way of safeguarding the interest of the elderly.
We would like to put forward proposal to prevent them being poorly treated as, sadly, frequently occurs, but we do not have the money to do so. Once a year, the mayor of the village invite u all to a lentil supper, similar to the lentil stew Jacob gave Esau in the Bible.
That one meal is all we get the whole year, but there is nothing practical we can do about it.'
So, roll on the financing for the action to combat age-discrimination provided for in the Cashman report.
That is why I voted for the motion.
We Independents welcome the action programme proposed by the Commission for fighting discrimination.
But we vehemently reject the proposal submitted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to set up another special unit for the implementation of this programme.
Discrimination cannot be tackled by creating additional administrative bodies; but solely by changing people' s attitudes.
Communicating traditional value such a tolerance and respect for diversity can do far more to help achieve this goal than the most detailed annual report on the various form of discrimination.
Report Mann (A5-0264/2000)
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I would like to draw two point requiring clarification to your attention.
I will deal firstly with Amendment No 15.
This amendment highlight a procedure concerning the acquis communautaire.
The Association Agreements concluded between the European Union and the candidate countries, and those which have yet to be concluded, should incorporate regulation banning discrimination against group protected under Article 13.
It is all the more crucial for this step to be taken if certain candidate country have minority that require protection on the employment and occupation front.
Secondly: Amendment No 18.
The amendment refers to the fact that many Member States have provision in place that could lead to discrimination against homosexual seeking employment.
However, the amendment doe not emphasise the importance of criminal law provision in dealing with such behaviour.
It take the form of a recommendation, in a much a it state that the Member States should annul these provisions.
In phrasing it this way, the principle of subsidiarity is upheld.
This doe not fall within Europe' s sphere of competence.
I wa slightly disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to get majority support for the need to set a limit on the storage of documents.
I had proposed six to twelve months. As I see it, that would be realistic in operational terms.
I worked for company for many years.
We were unable to achieve this.
What we did manage to achieve though, and what pleased me enormously, wa that we were able to make it abundantly clear that special regulation must be introduced for religious communities, because we must make it possible for people to identify with the idea behind and the fundamental aim of these communities.
We scored a major common victory there, to my mind, and we also finally managed to secure regulation benefiting the physically handicapped.
I am delighted that people have been so willing to compromise today, a indeed our voting ha shown.
I would like to thank you all again most warmly for your excellent teamwork.
Mr President, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 15 month now.
Today, 5 October 2000, did not start well, but it ha become the happiest day of my time at Parliament, for today Amendment No 62 to Mr Thomas Mann's report ha been adopted.
I strongly supported this amendment, which reads: "no discrimination a regard access to health care, welfare benefits, and economic assistance shall be permitted on the ground of the age of a disabled person" .
In my opinion, this is an extremely important result: it show - if I may be permitted to rejoice at this, Mr President - that there is some point to my being here.
I would like to thank the Members who helped and supported me - for I could not have achieved this result alone - Mr Speroni of the Lega Nord, Mr Thomas Mann, the rapporteur, from the European People's Party, Mrs Lambert of the Group of the Greens and Mr Helmer from the British Conservative Party.
They have risen above party politics and shown that, when an amendment is right, they will support it, whoever the author.
I have not voted for the Mann report because, while it is indeed necessary to seek equal treatment for people in employment and occupation, it is also necessary to refrain from pushing zeal to the point of abandoning all protection of freedom and all respect for the rule of law.
For example, Article 9(1) of the proposal for a directive, provides that when person who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment ha not been applied to them take action, they need only establish a presumption of discrimination before the court; making it incumbent on the defendant, that is, the employer, to prove wrongful accusation.
This article ha been slightly modified by an amendment from the European Parliament, which complicates the wording, but doe not alter the general thrust.
If this directive were adopted, it would then be up to the accused employer to prove his innocence, not up to the accuser to provide evidence for his claim.
Thus, the usual principle of the rule of law are being gradually altered under the influence of an extremist approach to combating discrimination, with the European Parliament and Commission only too happy to join in and poke their nose into every national law.
Yet again, we cannot approve of this shift, which is also going to be boosted by the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, because it present wording extends the anti-discrimination clause that the Treaty of Amsterdam ha already introduced into European law.
During the Treaty of Amsterdam negotiation we were delighted with the inclusion of Article 13 on discrimination on the ground of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation.
That kind of provision bear witness to the Community' s commitment to promote a more just, more egalitarian society, and above all, it ha opened the way to appropriate Community action aimed at contributing to the fight against discrimination in general.
It mean the effort made by the Community to promote gender equality can be completed by attacking new ground for discrimination.
It give new and significant impetus to Community action in an area where a certain legislative acquis and fruitful cooperation with civil society exist.
That is the basis on which measure to combat discrimination have been adopted.
The proposal consist of two draft directives, covering discrimination in employment and discrimination based on race and ethnic origin, and an action programme intended to support the effort of the Member States.
As regard the parallel directive on equal treatment irrespective of race or ethnic origin, the Council succeeded in reaching political agreement after the European Parliament revised it opinion on the issue.
We have therefore had to vote on the directive on equal treatment in employment and the 2001/2006 Action Programme.
To explain my votes, I would first say that the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination is a fundamental human right.
But while this right ha been recognised, it is very far from being converted into reality, hence the advantage of adopting determined and coordinated measure at European level.
As regard the Mann report on equal treatment in employment, I shall limit myself to emphasising my satisfaction that the ground for derogation have been successfully reduced to the minimum.
Otherwise the door would be opened to abuse contrary to the aim of this directive.
Certain possibility remain and I have to admit I am unhappy about them.
These are the ground for derogation in matter of religion.
The provision for derogation on religious ground on the basis of the notion of essential and direct occupational requirement carry the risk of broad interpretation.
As a confirmed secularist, I cannot associate myself with that.
Similarly, I am concerned about the derogation authorised on the basis of age, a older people are particularly at risk of discrimination in relation to employment.
As regard the action programme to fight discrimination, the European Commission' s proposal wa broadly satisfactory.
There were some deplorable gap and inaccuracy which have been corrected, with my support.
I felt it wa essential to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty.
I am also very pleased that harassment will in future be regarded a a form of discrimination and that there is recognition that discrimination must be prevented, not just combated.
It wa important to reaffirm the need to associate the candidate country with this programme.
Everyone is well aware of the problem faced by certain minority in those countries.
My final comment relates to the budget for this programme, EUR 98.4 million. That figure is obviously inadequate given the action envisaged.
In conclusion, I support the spirit of these proposal and I have voted for most of them, the exception being where they are in contradiction with my secularism.
The proposal for a directive on equal treatment in employment and occupation before u today is a response to a demand long expressed by the European Parliament, and our group in particular.
It is actually one of three part of a package of measure on combating discrimination based on the new Article 13, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and includes a Community action programme.
These text should, then, fill a glaring gap in the construction of Europe: recognition of the real need of people excluded or marginalised in our society because of disability, age, or membership of a minority.
The text therefore represent some of the first step towards the people' s Europe that we have wanted for so long.
So, I enthusiastically support this proposal for a directive and the very positive amendment proposed by our rapporteur to improve it effectiveness.
In so doing, I wish to stress the importance of the amendment to improve the protection of people with disability by clarifying the term 'reasonable accommodation' of the workplace and 'undue hardship' for the employer, and those toughening the ban on discrimination against older people who freely choose to go on working - 63% of Europeans aged 55-64 do not work - and those strengthening the vital autonomy of management and the union a well a the crucial role of social dialogue in actually implementing equal treatment in businesses.
In parallel, the amendment extending the exception to the principle of non-discrimination to the wider 'social' activity of religious organisations, where the discrimination is solely based on religious conviction and on no other grounds, is a reinforcement of the specific nature and original contribution of these structure a compared with public or private services.
On the other hand, the amendment providing for penalty against company infringing the principle of equal treatment by excluding them from public contract seem to me both poorly adapted to the purpose and subject to divergent interpretation.
In addition, they open the door to distortion in competition between business in different European Union countries.
That is why I wish to express reservation on that point, while voting in favour of the text a a whole.
The SNP welcome this directive and it aim to end discrimination in the workplace.
The unfair treatment of worker on the ground of race, religious belief, disability, age or sexual orientation can in no way be justified in a modern and socially just Europe.
This directive give Member States a great opportunity to enhance the right of worker across the European Union.
The SNP is pleased to support this legislation, which is in line with our party's policy of ending discrimination in all it guise and of positively backing measure to ensure equality of treatment for all citizens.
Moreover the SNP see this legislation a a mean to fulfil the underlying objective of the European Union in recognising that equality in the field of employment help combat social exclusion and assist the EU's aim of permitting the free movement of it citizens.
Amendment No 18: the directive under discussion concern a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and the over-generalised wording in Amendment No 18 is not relevant in all aspect to this directive.
It is manifestly clear from the justification for the amendment that the purpose is also to interfere in provision on age that apply in Member States, which, in any case, are fully justified for reason of psychological development, and they do not have any kind of impact in the job market.
For these reason I voted against the amendment, although discrimination in employment and occupation in all it form must be opposed.
Amendment No 37: the form the committee have proposed for Article 4.2 of this directive is good and could ensure there is a significant degree of continuity in the wider social activity of religious organisations, which is a basis for all European socio-political thinking, and is still an important part of it activity in practice.
In addition, the wording proposed by the committee reconfirms the vitality of the individual culture and custom of small, immigrant communities, among others.
For these reason I voted in favour of the amendment.
Our colleague, Thomas Mann, ha invested a great deal of work in a report on the proposal for a Council directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.
His report wa adopted unanimously in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
However, we then had 13 improvement amendment to consider, in addition to the 60 contained in the Mann report on the directive proposed by the Commission.
There is a saying we would do well not to ignore in our effort to amend the Commission proposals, which are actually well thought through a a rule, and this is how it go 'what is better is the enemy of what is good' .
That is only common sense in fact.
One could not help but wonder if common sense had always prevailed in the drafting of certain, no doubt well-meaning, proposed amendment that were now before us.
If the directive is to be adopted and implemented, it must not be encumbered with a literary approach and wishful thinking, which have no place in a legal document.
That is most certainly true of the amendment which proposes that this directive should end the sexually discriminatory practice of stipulating that only male personnel can wear a tie.
If absurdity could kill then the author of such an amendment would definitely no longer be with us.
I think it is also going too far to expect employer to provide statistic on all aspect of their employment of people falling within the scope of this directive.
The authority already have their work cut out.
This brings to mind another sound rule of thumb: 'no one can achieve the impossible' .
I also think that we can do without the entire content of the new Article 12 (a).
The Commission rightly refrained - on the basis of the subsidiarity principle, of course - from instructing the Member States to set up new institution for monitoring the application of the principle of equal treatment, which could be consulted by every conceivable, and inconceivable, group of people or association etc, requesting free handling of their complaints, and which could even be granted access to confidential personnel files.
Despite all the inconsistency and superfluous proposals, which do nothing to help the cause, I did not want to vote against the report at the final vote.
But here too, I feel that 'less would have been more' , and the Commission proposal, without the superfluous amendments, is the better and more logical instrument for ensuring equal treatment in employment and occupation, which is, after all, what we want.
I warmly welcome this proposal to establish a framework to combat discrimination and ensure equal treatment in employment.
The area covered are access to employment and occupation, vocational training, promotion, employment condition and membership of certain bodies.
The proposal cover both direct and indirect discrimination.
Harassment is also included within the definition of discrimination.
With regard to disability, the principle of equal treatment entail the identification and removal of barrier in the way of person with disability who, with reasonable accommodation, are able to perform the essential function of a job.
While the proposal continues to allow difference of treatment on the ground of age they have to be objectively justified.
The proposal also allows positive action to redress gender imbalance.
These proposal deserve the serious attention of the Member States and the other Community Institutions.
The EPLP ha voted for the Mann report on equal treatment in discrimination because it is firmly committed to the principle of combating unjustified discrimination and is broadly supportive of the overall objective behind this proposal.
However the EPLP ha strong reservation about the following areas.
On disability, whilst we welcome the principle of the proposals, the UK are justly proud of our own disability discrimination legislation, but we do not want to impose our model on other Member States.
However, we do want to ensure the directive let u continue with the approach in the Disability Discrimination Act, although we recognise that some relatively minor change may be required.
On age, the EPLP welcome the principle of fighting age discrimination in employment and training.
This is a very complex area and the proposal are far-reaching and ambitious.
However, we feel it is important that the Community ha legislation which is clear and workable.
On religion/belief, the EPLP welcome the principle of protection on these grounds.
For the UK this would end the anomaly whereby two non-major Christian group (Jews, Sikhs), receive protection both from direct and indirect discrimination under the UK Race Relations Act a they are recognised by the court a ethnic group a well a religious groups.
Under some circumstances, Muslims receive protection, but only in case of indirect discrimination, whilst Afro-Caribbean Muslims, white Muslims and indeed Christians, receive no protection at all.
However, the UK is one of the most religiously diverse population in the European Union, so it is important that the proposal are right.
The EPLP is concerned to ensure that the directive will permit Section 60 of the UK Schools Standard and Framework Act 1998 to remain unaltered.
On sexual orientation, we welcome the principle of the Commission's proposal to fight discrimination on this ground.
Further Concerns:
Much of the text will need further clarification before it is finalised.
We have concern about the unclear definition of 'reasonable accommodation' and 'undue hardship' in Article 2(4), and the possible contradiction with the public procurement directive in the amendment on Article 55.
Several area of difference with the race directive should be eliminated, such a the definition of indirect discrimination in Amendment No 21, the defence of right in Article 8, the text on victimisation in Article 10, and Article 11 covering dissemination of information.
We also feel that the directive should be clear about which difference of treatment on the ground of age are permissible and which are not.
We have concern about several element which appear to be overburdensome: notably application of the legislation to volunteer worker in charity and to public posts, and also compulsory collection and monitoring of statistics.
We are concerned about the inclusion of health, social security and assistance a there are considerable national difference in how these matter are handled and whether they form part of the employee/employer relationship.
There are also element which, we feel, should be left to Member States such a overall implementation, provision of training to particular age group of workers, the nature of a mediation system, and how SMEs are to interpret the directive.
Finally, some element should be permissive rather than mandatory to cater for different Member State practices.
We believe that the negation to come will provide an opportunity to tackle these issue and we look forward to enactment of the directive and the benefit it will bring to worker in the UK and other EU countries.
I voted against these report because they enshrine within them the principle that sex perversion is elevated onto the level of holy marriage and sex only within the marriage bond.
They also discriminate against people and organisation who believe the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God, the only infallible Rule of Faith and Practice, forcing such believer to employ those who propagate and practise act of sex totally against the scriptural ethics.
It is on this issue alone that I voted no.
Broadly speaking, the Christian Democrats welcome the proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for employment equality.
However, we feel that the committee' s amendment concerning statistic divided according to target group - i.e. based on the existing reason for discrimination, such a race, ethnic origin, age, religion or belief, a well a sexual orientation - is far too great a violation of integrity.
We have therefore decided to vote against this amendment, but we support the report a such.
Report Van Hulten (A5-0260/2000)
I have abstained on the van Hulten report because I do not think we should increase the number of controlling authority within the European institutions.
This 'control frenzy' actually lead to official being freed from responsibility, to a situation where everyone try to palm off responsibility on the controllers, and the controller of the controllers.
The European Union suffers from a bad image among many citizens.
Rapporteur Van Hulten expressed the following view in an interview with a Dutch weekly magazine, "It is called Europe, it is in Brussels and is corrupt."
Thanks to the action taken by a "whistle blower" and the Committee of Wise Men, corruption ha been brought out into the open.
In the interview, Mr Van Hulten is right in saying that we will not be able to draft a positive agenda until we have solved problem such a fraud, waste, but also a lack of efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making.
The financial reform, more specifically the establishment of an internal audit department, is conducive to the European Union' s effectiveness.
Rapporteur Van Hulten is right in filling in the gap in the Commission proposal: what is needed is a clear definition of the distribution of responsibility between financial control and internal audit.
But if Mr Van Hulten would like to dedicate himself to an efficient and effective Union, we, along with the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, cannot see why he should exempt smaller institutions, such a the Committee of the Regions, from internal audit duty.
This view is at the expense of transparency of the financial regulation.
Naturally the number of transaction in the smaller institution is smaller than in the large one - the 800 000 transaction performed annually in the Commission eclipse the 10 000 transaction performed annually in the Committee of the Regions.
But this only say something about the staffing level of the internal audit department and nothing about the financial significance and hence usefulness of such a department.
This is the reason why I have applied for split voting on Amendment No 3. In this way, it will still be possible to include the obligation of an internal audit department in the proposal.
Although the rapporteur share my view that all institution must be given equal treatment, he would like to postpone this equal treatment until the definitive review of the financial regulation in eighteen months' time.
In my view, if the opportunity present itself to step up efficiency within the EU institutions, each day that pass while we are waiting is one too many.
To set up an internal audit office in the institution will naturally require effort, but that effort will remain the same, whether it is made now or in the future.
The image of Europe is not served by the efficient operation of the large EU institution alone; in many respects, it is probably the small one that make all the difference.
Report Titley (A5-0211/2000)
I am sure, in common with all my colleagues, we support the proper management and control of arm export in the European Union.
We have many example of how uncontrolled and unscrupulous arm export have exacerbated many of the conflict in the past century and even into the present time.
We, in Europe, along with our colleague across the globe, have to see that the mistake and greed of the past are not repeated.
The reason of my vote on this report relate, in the main, to the question of closer European Union relation with NATO and also the onward rush to a common defence policy.
Many will speak about peace and conflict resolution while at the same time will be making deal to sell arm to combatants.
If this two-faced policy were stopped then many of the difficulty could be overcome.
As stated at the outset, I am in favour of greater control over arm exports, but this issue should not be confused with other political initiatives.
Even if we sympathise with the idea of regulating the European production and export of arm politically, we are sceptical about the Titley report, mainly for the following reasons.
There is no link between the development of the arm industry and EU cooperation in the area of military policy.
The EU ha decided to develop a joint military capacity in order to fulfil the so-called Petersberg objective (crisis management and conflict resolution outside the territory of the EU), but it ha no common defence policy.
The individual EU country are member of NATO and the WEU, or else are non-aligned.
Policy on arm export must start from that point, and a distinction must be made between supervising an arm industry developed for political reason (namely crisis management) and arm export for purely commercial reasons. In our view, such export ought to be kept to a minimum and, in the long term, completely abolished.
We are particularly opposed to the wording of Paragraph R and Paragraph 1 d) and e) of the report, to the effect that the development of arm export should lead to the development of a common defence policy and the establishment of a defence identity within NATO, and that the arm industry should benefit from the EU' s developing a common code of conduct on arm exports.
We welcome the initiative for code of conduct for arm exports.
Many of Mr Titley' s proposal and comment in the report represent improvement to the Council' s original report.
Nonetheless, we have decided to vote against Mr Titley' s report for the following reasons:
The report mean continued recognition of the importance of a strong European military capacity instead of placing the emphasis on the need for disarmament and peace.
The report see arm export control primarily a a method of avoiding awkward situation for Europe' s military industry and not a a way of achieving disarmament and peace.
Moreover, the report discus European arm export a a way of solving future local conflict in the immediate vicinity of Europe.
Despite the request from the Group of the Greens, the rapporteur ha also consistently failed to discus Turkey which, through it membership of NATO, is in practice excluded from the code of conduct.
The report also mean that Europe' s war industry is regarded a an economically important industry, and that is an indefensible perspective on an industry whose primary task is implicitly to kill and annihilate people.
As long a the European Parliament is unable to make the logical connection between the production and sale of arm and the continued global military destruction of the environment and human life, we cannot support report such a this.
support this report from my colleague, Gary Titley, and agree with him that responsible arm trade practice form part of the "acquis communautaire" and therefore candidate country should be actively involved in the further development of the Code of Conduct on arm export and that this should be legally binding.
I particularly share his view that there is a need to establish common rule and effective EU control to combat illegal arm trafficking and to control the legal trade in small arm and light weapons.
I trust the Member States will give this considered and early attention.
The world would be a safer place without weapons.
I am therefore in favour of a code of conduct which render it impossible to produce and export arm and which result in arm factory switching over to the production of useful commodities.
From this perspective, I have read Mr Titley' s proposal and examined to what extent his text contributes to a world of peace without weapons.
In general terms, I endorse the small step forward, even if they do not, by any means, completely lead to the solution put forward by myself.
It is a different matter if such a small step forward put a spanner in the work when it come to reaching real solutions.
I believe that the choice today is not between complete freedom in the arm trade and this code of conduct.
If these were the two options, I would endorse the code of conduct a the lesser of the two evils, the underlying rationale being that something is better than nothing.
However, the real choice is between this code of conduct and a complete ban.
The code of conduct is based on the assumption that the arm trade will continue to exist and that European arm production must be promoted.
The excrescence are being regulated because it is they that draw attention and instil indignation.
The issue of the arm trade itself remains out of range.
To me, this is a reason not to support the code of conduct.
- (SV) It is good that the European Union wish to implement a code of conduct to restrict arm exports.
However, I cannot accept the introduction of the requirement of a common defence policy and a European security and defence policy within NATO.
Sweden is neutral and doe not intend to enter into any defence alliance.
Consequently, I cannot support these viewpoints, expressed either in Recital R or in Paragraphs 1 c, 1 d and 1 e.
France, Germany and Great Britain, together with the USA, are the main arm dealer feeding the planet' s conflicts: in Africa, where 10 state are at war, and in Asia, between India and Pakistan.
The European state have sold arm to Indonesia, whose army is implicated in the massacre in Timor and the Moluccas.
France is selling helicopter to Turkey, which is waging war against the Kurdish people, and aircraft to China and Taiwan, not to mention the scandal of the famous Taiwan frigates.
In the recent past, France wa an accomplice to the genocide in Rwanda by delivering any amount of small arm to the regime perpetrating the massacres.
No one ha yet insisted that the European Union and France answer for that.
The resolution is not seeking to reduce arm sale radically to promote a policy of disarmament, but just to regulate them in order to guarantee greater profit for the industrial groups.
There is no such thing a a bloodless war.
There are only war that kill.
This hypocritical resolution seek the implementation of a 'European code of conduct' while simultaneously declaring that the defence industry is 'economically and strategically important for the EU' .
We take the view that the restructuring of the defence industry should not be motivated by the political ambition to create a common defence policy, but by the strategic and industrial requirement of the major company and Member States involved.
On this basis, link-ups between European and North American company are a much to be welcomed a between European companies.
While we can support a code of conduct which set out a level playing field with a set of rule to which we can all voluntarily adhere, we do not wish to encumber industry with more unnecessary regulations.
In particular, we do not support the proposal, in Paragraph 9 of the resolution, that the code of conduct should be made legally binding.
Our objection to this are four-fold: the possibility of yet another range of activity being justiciable in the European Court of Justice is opened up; the possibility of obtaining agreement by other arm exporting country outside the EU to an international code of conduct will be that much more difficult and unattractive if it is legally binding; if legal sanction are involved there is a danger that some of those involved in the arm trade will be le open in their activities; there may be reluctance by some country to place arm order with European state which are encumbered by legislation, particularly when a long-term after-sales support relationship may be involved.
While there is much that we can agree with in this resolution there are a number of fundamental flaw and this is why we have abstained in our vote.
Report Angelilli (A5-0258/2000)
Children are the first victim of violence on television.
We all now recognise the impact and the harm which the daily and increasing bombardment of violent television programme and similar multimedia product wreaks on young people, who are le discerning because their critical faculty are not fully developed.
The Commission text and the report contain a number of accurate finding a regard the adverse impact on the psychological makeup and developing personality of child and, consequently, on the danger in store for tomorrow' s society a the result of their watching these programme and using these products.
However, their proposal are confined to watershed and programme classification and, in adopting the Oxford University report on television programme filtering devices, which parent have to buy before they can use them to protect their children, are targeted specifically at digital and subscriber television.
Once again, the delicate and sensitive issue of the protection of our children, i.e. the member of tomorrow' s society, are being hijacked by commercialisation and the profit motive.
The entire onus of protecting child is on the parent and the question of the actual production and broadcasting of programme which are harmful to child is hardly even touched on.
And, assuming that they can afford these filtering devices, how are parent supposed to protect their child from so-called children' s programmes, the majority of which contain scene of violence and some of which are scarier than horror films?
And how are they supposed to protect them from the violence which inundates multimedia product and the Internet?
The Commission communication acknowledges the problem but proposes no specific measure because it is blinkered by the philosophy of market liberalisation and competition, and any proposal which it make fail to get to the heart of the harsh reality - a reality especially harsh on child - of the unaccountability of multinationals which, in their lust for profit, are indifferent to the impact which their programme and product have and which not only shift the entire responsibility to parent but even expect them to buy new product to protect their children.
The only reference to company is to do with a code of self-regulation.
We do agree with a number of interesting proposal on protecting child in the Angelilli report, such a the need for a detailed study into the moral and legal aspect of the protection of minors.
I have today voted against Roberta Angelilli' s report on the communication from the Commission on an investigation concerning parental control of television broadcasting.
If I do so, it is not because I am opposed to the report a such but because I should like to send a clear signal to the effect that the EU and the Commission should concentrate on their core tasks.
It is not a task for the EU but for the Member States to take initiative in this area.
There are enough other pressing task for the Commission to expend it energy on.
As the father of two small children, I have taken a particular interest in the result of the study on parental control of television broadcasting.
Under the provision of Article 22b(2) of the 'Television without frontiers' directive (Directive 97/36/EC of 30 June 1997, amending Directive 89/552/EC), the Commission wa required to conduct an inquiry into the advantage and possible disadvantage of measure designed to facilitate control by parent and educationalist over the programme minor can watch.
I am delighted this study ha been completed.
The legal and ethical framework doe indeed vary from one Member State to another in line with national tradition and culture.
There is no single European definition of a minor nor is there full agreement on what is or is not harmful to minor watching certain television programmes.
Everyone agrees, however, that it is in the public interest to make a decisive stand against the wave of violence and other content dangerous to young people which is flooding television programme and audiovisual service transmitted via networks, in order to protect the psychological balance of minors.
Minors are different from adults.
They are more vulnerable, le able to exercise critical judgement and at greater risk of being disturbed.
Like the rapporteur, I believe measure intended to protect young people from violent and harmful programme should not be limited to traditional television but should apply to all media.
I also think it is essential to put the emphasis on teaching child medium skills.
So there is a need to strengthen national and regional awareness-raising campaign on the protection of minor in the medium context, involving family and the education world.
Also, television programme filtering device must be sold at price affordable to all.
At the same time, such measure obviously do not imply that the service provider should in any way be relieved of all responsibility for the content they broadcast.
Given that issue linked to radio and television are the responsibility of the Member States, I support the request made to them that they and the Commission lay down in law the responsibility incumbent on the medium companies.
I also think it is essential for European Union television operator to draw up a code of self-regulation for the protection of minors.
I end by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work.
I welcome the main provision of this report, which highlight once again the importance that the European Parliament attache to the protection of our young child in Europe.
This report confirms that it is in the public interest to protect child from viewing excessive television violence and other programme that may produce harmful effects.
The subject of this report is both highly specific and highly complex.
Any further analysis of specific technology such a filtering system will have to take account of the advance in technology which are evident today.
This report is based on the principle of common sense.
It is premised on the need for television broadcasting to take responsibility for the protection of minor by mean of a self-regulatory code which should apply throughout the European Union.
A committee of expert will also be constituted at a European Community level with the mandate of drawing up a memorandum setting out general principle for the protection of minor in the medium context.
It is now incumbent on the European Commission and the European Parliament and all interested party to work together to see how best young people can be protected from viewing excessive television violence.
I would hope that the key television broadcasting organisations, both from the private and the public sector within the European Union, will engage positively in this process.
Certainly we must recognise that technology is changing rapidly within the television sector within Europe.
Digitalisation of old analogue television network is taking place across the length and breadth of the participating Member States of the EU.
This, too, will lead to greater challenge for legislator to put in place the necessary protective measure to guarantee that young child are protected from viewing wholly violent and inappropriate television programmes.
I will be working closely at national European level to ensure that EU government implement the necessary legislation to put in place the necessary protective mechanism which I have addressed.
TV is now an essential part of daily life.
With viewing averaging three hour per day, it is the most extensive human activity after sleep and - for adult - work.
Changes at work, like more working woman and more flexible hours, mean child are increasingly left alone with the small screen.
There are various solutions, but none is satisfactory.
A self-regulation code for professional is an excellent solution, however.
I feel that this is the right direction.
As the rapporteur ha stressed, parental control must not end with TV.
Children are also great consumer of the Internet and video games.
The approach must include all form of image transmission.
She spell out the difficulty of operating at Community level, when every Member State ha it own history and it own special relationship with it national television. Individual cultural feature are reflected in the content of programmes.
I also support the amendment from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party which contribute useful detail on 'who doe what' .
I should like to congratulate Mrs Angelilli on the proposal in her report on developing control mechanism to protect child from watching violent and other broadcast which are unsuitable for their age.
I agree with them completely; however, I should like to point out that this is a minor issue at a time when there is a major issue at stake. What I mean is that these proposal are contained in a non-binding Commission communication, while the binding "Television without frontiers"; directive (97/36/ÅC) to which they refer is being infringed time and again by almost every Member State.
Under these circumstances, it is essential that all the Member States comply with Community legislation a quickly a possible.
Furthermore, I have ascertained from a personal investigation in the relevant Commission service that eight Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and the UK) are applying Community legislation, while the rest (France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) are infringing it one way or another.
I also agree with my fellow Member that these measure should not be confined solely to television and should also apply to the Internet, which no longer ha any reason to "envy" television, now that it multiple application include film projections.
If all these proposal are to be translated from theory into practice, we need to create filtering and classification mechanism which allow parent to select the programme which are suitable for their children.
Encouraging industry to move in this direction through international collaboration and increasing parents' , teachers' and children' s awareness will act a a catalyst.
Report Dybkjær (A5-0198/2000)
This third annual report on equal opportunity for woman and men in the European Union set out the highlight and success of the year 1998.
It must be said that although equality between woman and men ha been proclaimed by law, the fact are there to remind u that the discrimination and difficulty woman face unfortunately persist.
Women are the most vulnerable to unemployment.
The 1998 report make a special study of the phenomenon of unemployment and the economic impact of under-employment of women.
It also analysis the measure taken to incorporate employment policy strictly focused on woman or policy to restrict gender discrimination in employment, for example, in employment contracts, type of employment and remuneration.
Moreover, woman are often in 'flexible' jobs; temporary contract and low salary are typical in sector where woman employee are in a majority.
Women' s career are often unstable, and they can only acquire experience with difficulty.
That situation is often illustrated by low level of social protection and precarious living conditions.
Women are also over-represented in 'typically female' occupation but under-represented in job with responsibility and in the professions.
Furthermore, woman are not a well represented a men in rapidly growing sector such a information and communication technologies, with woman tending to occupy the lowest level in the hierarchy.
It is therefore crucial to restore balance by establishing education and training policy specifically geared to young women.
Gender disparity is also prevalent when it come to wage and salaries. Figures available for 1995 show that for the European Union a a whole, the hourly wage for a woman is only 73% of that for a man doing equal work.
I therefore fully support the rapporteur in urging the Commission to pursue it effort and in particular to strengthen the 'strategic' nature of it annual reports, by assessing the effectiveness of policy initiative rather than contenting itself with describing them.
I also think it is necessary to stress that Community standard of respect for women' s right and equal opportunity should be implemented in the candidate country even before they join.
Finally, I invite the Member States to pursue the dual strategy advocated at Community level, involving mainstreaming and specific action for women.
Interestingly, this is the first time that the need for the Commission' s annual report to go further in it evaluation of the efficacy of political initiative ha been identified.
What we have before u is a motion which, although not lacking in proposal for study and research, stop well short of a real approach which will highlight crucial problem not yet resolved and the new problem which are beginning to threaten existing right and achievements, together with their real causes.
Women are still one of the most vulnerable section of society, whose right are rudely trampled underfoot by the current social and economic system.
That is what we should have acknowledged first, then we would not have had such a knee-jerk report singing praise and dispensing declaration of intent.
Equal opportunity at work, equal social participation, equality in health and elsewhere are impossible within a framework of reactionary policy offensive to human dignity a a whole, without equal social prospects, in a society of unemployment and underemployment, with no welfare state, a society in which human value are costed and commercialised.
Social right and social achievement are not expanding; on the contrary, they are increasingly being eroded on the ground that they are too expensive.
The flexible, elastic form of employment generously offered to woman are not a sign of progress; they are sleight of hand by the economically powerful in a bid to counteract the economic crisis and safeguard competitiveness and excessive profit at the expense of worker and women. And the first victim are women, who still get le pay for the same work, who still tend to occupy inferior, unskilled jobs, who face more problem and who have unequal access to the job market.
They are the first to fall foul of cut in public spending, privatisation of the health sector, the right to health care and medical attention - never mind the right to prevention and information programmes.
They work in condition which are bad for their physical, mental and spiritual health, condition which affect woman more than men because they have to juggle so many duty and take on double and triple social roles.
Even the report acknowledges that, "In addition to their general failure to substantiate the impact of policy and programmes, the report also fail to discus the factor behind continuing inequality."
How can progress in resolving women' s problem and offering them institutional protection against all form of discrimination be planned and strengthened within the framework of a social and economic system which commercialises and subject everything to the rigour of public financial policy and the quest for greater profit?
A policy of fundamental protection for woman cannot be implemented unless we redirect and radically restructure our social development model.
In the face of plan and practice to exploit and oppress, in the face of discriminatory tactics, we call on woman to enforce and claim their demand together with men within the framework of a wide grass-roots battle front in each individual country.
Although it ha some positive points, this motion merely skirt round the problem.
We fear that it proclamation and good intention are, yet again, no more than 'lame excuses' .
That concludes the vote.
(The sitting wa suspended at 1.06 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subject of major importance.
Peru
The next item is the joint debate on the following motion for resolutions:
B5-0777/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the crisis in Peru;
B5-0780/2000, by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Peru;
B5-0784/2000, by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the crisis in Peru;
B5-0790/2000, by Mr Lipietz and Mr Nogueira Román, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance, on the crisis in Peru;
B5-0792/2000, by Mr Marset Campos and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the crisis in Peru.
Mr President, I have here a speech I gave on 9 April 1992, in which I referred to the coup, the so-called self-inflicted coup, by President Fujimori, and at the time I said that it wa not acceptable for a democratically elected president to relinquish his legitimacy by relying on the armed forces.
Since the last electoral farce, Fujimori ha lost his legitimacy and not only that, but he ha lost the political support that he previously had.
At the moment, the question that arises is the future of Peru, of knowing whether the country will be able to get out of the difficult situation in which Mr Fujimori ha now placed it.
Various political group have presented a joint draft resolution in which we basically ask President Fujimori to go, but to do so in such a way that, through a process of clean and democratic elections, democracy can be consolidated in that country.
Secondly, we ask the institution of the European Union to help the democratic process in Peru, which is something that they are capable of doing.
We are also asking for a delegation from the European Parliament to go to Peru in order to monitor the development of event on the ground.
We hope that Fujimori doe not make thing worse, that he make this transition possible and that in Peru there will not be the same situation a there currently is in Belgrade, with a popular uprising that is practically on the streets.
Therefore, I think that if the European institution and the European Parliament help the Peruvian people at this difficult time, we could contribute to the stability of the country and to the consolidation of democratic institution across Latin America.
Mr President, Peru is currently going through a period of uncertainty, and we all cherish the hope that the current situation will be resolved through a process in which all civil and political right are guaranteed, which will help to strengthen and consolidate democracy and peace in Peru, a country that ha suffered 25 000 death in the last fifteen years.
The European Union, which is the leading cooperating country in economic term and the main investor in Peru, with figure exceeding 6 000 million dollar in the last seven years, must maintain it cooperation based on the democratic clause established in the third and fourth generation agreement with the country of the Andean Pact. These are based on universally recognised principle of respect for pluralist democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
Also, the European Union must, with maximum care, invite all the Peruvian democratic force to take part in dialogue in order to achieve commitment guaranteeing the exercise of civil and public right and freedom of expression.
Mr President, we are delighted to have confirmation of what we predicted in a recent vote.
The European Parliament firmly rejected the election of Mr Fujimori and I am pleased to see honourable Members in the two main group committing themselves clearly to strong European Parliament support for establishing democracy in Peru.
But we are concerned about the fate of Mr Montesinos.
The right of asylum cannot be used to protect criminals.
The whole world rejoiced when the international resolution finally began to work against one former dictator, Mr Pinochet.
Mr Montesinos cannot be allowed to find refuge in Panama or, a some rumour are beginning to suggest, in Morocco.
He should be brought to trial on the ground of torture, drug-trafficking and the rest by any state where he seek refuge.
Mr President, the Peruvian people' s desire for peace, democracy, justice and well-being is coming closer to being realised with the resignation of Mr Fujimori.
The adverse effect that North American backing for him ha had on those desire must be neutralised by another influence, a positive influence in favour of human right and full democratic progress, coming from the European Union.
For this reason, we feel it is necessary to highlight two aspect of the joint resolution that we are presenting.
The first aspect is that the European Union should deny asylum - and not negotiate with other country either - to a figure such a Montesinos, who is responsible for terrible crime against humanity.
The second is that a delegation should be sent from the European Parliament to Peru with the purpose of assessing the prospect for democratic progress and for peacefully overcoming the present problems, so that our contribution will be a very positive one.
Mr President, I would prefer it if, for once, we could have a debate on Latin America following well-prepared discussion in the committees, rather than it being part of some urgent procedure or other.
It seems to me that we only ever deal with event in Latin America on a case by case basis, but otherwise pursue a very reticent policy.
It is a shame, because the continent merit more attention.
As far a Peru is concerned, a number of speakers, and also our resolution, have pointed to the fact that President Fujimori' s forthcoming resignation offer scope for a fresh start.
I am not so sure whether this will be the case though, because there have already been one or two disturbing development on this front, and I will only be convinced once Fujimori ha actually stepped down or been voted out of office.
I therefore think it is extremely important for the European Union to get fully involved with this country, and with the situation in Peru, for example by maintaining an orderly dialogue with the force of opposition.
I would like u to send the delegation that we wanted to send to the election - which then failed to take place for reason we are all familiar with - to Peru now, with a view to supporting those who are working towards democratic reform in the country.
And if that were to be the outcome of this afternoon' s sitting, I would be more than satisfied.
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the event in Peru are evidence of the world of difference that there can be between the formal meaning of word and their tangible weight.
The term in question is the word 'democracy'.
Peru ha a parliament which ha been elected by universal suffrage and a president who ha used the power of persuasion of the army to violate all constitutional precepts.
I feel that this resolution mark a key point in Parliament's political initiative.
I would like to focus briefly on one of the subject covered by the report: the call for Parliament to send a delegation.
The European Union ha got to do something and do it quickly.
The process of democracy need to be consolidated, but consolidated with political instrument and human resources.
We must ensure that, when Peru reach it goal, it ha candidate who are capable of rising to the challenge and responding to the Peruvian people's demand for political renewal and genuine democracy.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is why I strongly support the call for Parliament to send a delegation, not just to act a a witness should something go badly wrong, but, for once in it history, to support a country which is seeking a democratic way forward.
Mr President, the need for the resolution on the situation in Peru ha made two thing clear.
The first is our frustration at having to return to the vigilance over democracy and human right in Latin America, which wa of major concern to Parliament in the 1980s and which diminished in the 1990s with the emergence of democratic government in most country there.
It is also frustrating because, in addition to the situation in Peru, other attempt at aggressive populism are creating appalling dictatorships, which confirm our worst fear and mean that we must target Latin America once again in our vigilance over democracy.
Let u be quite frank: this resolution highlight the feeling that Europe' s influence on that sub-continent ha weakened.
Europe felt that it conscience no longer required it to intervene after the switch to democracy in the 1990s and did little for those countries, apart from giving advice on model of economic integration.
Opening up our market wa symbolic - with the exception of beef from Argentina, because of BSE a we know - but there wa very little technology transfer, cultural and political relation existed in name only, and career training and investment in added value made little progress.
Europe did not take the opportunity provided by the fledgling democracy to promote development and social justice in Latin America to help these country to break their almost exclusive dependence on accumulating capital, which is based on drug trafficking.
The situation with Peru and Mr Fujimori ha not yet degenerated into a disaster, Mr President. There are sign of disillusionment and the situation should serve, for the moment, a a warning.
In order to avert a disaster, it is absolutely crucial that Europe take it politics to the American sub-continent a well.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, the condition under which election were held in Peru in May this year, were unacceptable.
Against this background, the Commission gave it support to the Organisation of American States, whose brief is to monitor a range of significant democratic reform that the government and opposition had agreed on.
The European Union emphasised only very recently, in a declaration, that President Fujimori had seized the initiative with his decision to call fresh elections.
This initiative could prove to be an important step in the direction of democracy, but only if he refrain from employing the tactic that he ha announced he is going to use in these elections.
If this opportunity is to be made use of, a whole range of serious shortcoming are going to have to be overcome.
These are shortcoming that became apparent during the previous elections.
If these weakness are not dealt with, there is a risk that the next election will be extremely dubious too.
The Commission therefore support the Organisation of American States in the continuation of it work a per the schedule agreed at the time, and this notwithstanding the difficult condition and numerous imponderable that weigh heavily on these forthcoming new elections.
The Commission, in tandem with the Member States, is currently examining how we can best help, in practical terms, in the preparation of these plural and democratic elections, and, if need be, a observer of the process.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.
Afghanistan
The next item is the joint debate on the following motion for resolutions:
B5-0776/2000, by Mr van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation in Afghanistan;
B5-0778/2000, by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members, on the situation in Afghanistan;
B5-0781/2000, by Mrs Dybkjær and Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Afghanistan;
B5-0785/2000, by Mr Morillon, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the situation in Afghanistan;
B5-0789/2000, by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the situation in Afghanistan;
B5-0793/2000, by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the position of woman in Afghanistan.
Mr President, I think we owe a great deal to the man behind this resolution, General Morillon.
It is an important resolution because Afghanistan and it desperately suffering people, and especially it child who are blown up by mine and it woman who face appalling discrimination, deserve far more attention from us.
Thanks to this motion for a resolution, which ha found broad consensus, Parliament is taking a firm position.
As the resolution states, the fundamental political challenge is to put pressure on Afghanistan' s large neighbour, Pakistan, a a mean of trying to influence the situation in Afghanistan, I would also add the other large neighbour, the People' s Republic of China, with which Pakistan ha excellent relation and collaborates at military and nuclear level.
We also know that there is extensive cooperation between those two big countries, Pakistan and the People' s Republic of China, at the level of the political nomenklatura and the local mafia a regard drug trafficking.
We know Afghanistan is not far away, and we know it is the world' s largest producer of opiates, so we can well imagine the role played by these political mafias, which are not necessarily simply political, in the expansion of the drug trade.
We also know that the policy of the United Nations, especially that of UNDCP and Mr Arlacchi, is a disaster. Despite the million of dollar invested in Afghanistan in the course of the last few years, production ha doubled.
To summarise, I think pressure need to be exerted on Pakistan and the People' s Republic of China, all funding need to be withdrawn from Mr Arlacchi and UNDCP so that these prohibitionist policy on drug do not end up encouraging production and trade in drugs, because that is what is happening now.
Mr President, earlier in the day we had a debate about the right of woman in the European Union, and we also touched upon the question of the new candidate countries.
In facing a decision like this about the Taliban regime, it ha to be said that it ha really been a luxury, purely and simply, to discus the other issues, when one considers what is happening in Afghanistan.
Ever since I first heard about the Taliban regime, I have been appalled.
I find it completely incredible that such thing can still be going on in the year 2000, and not only do we not intervene, but we cannot, in reality, do a vast amount about them.
In war, there will clearly always be a large number of innocent people who suffer distress or die, and very often it is, of course' woman and child and old people who are totally defenceless in a wide range of situations.
What is happening here, however, is in fact even worse.
It is a far more systematic form of oppression than is to be seen in normal war situations.
It is far more systematic and far more violent in relation to a particular group of women.
It appears a if it is simply a question of group of men who find themselves in a world in which nothing else count but their own solidarity and their own oppression of women.
I therefore also think it good that the decision should include some clear and explicit point about the position of woman in particular and should draw attention to how necessary it is for u to try to help prevent the Taliban regime from continuing with it wholesale discrimination against women.
Is Afghanistan condemned to sink back into the dark age and suffocate slowly under the Taliban yoke, in the image of it woman under the weight of the obligatory chador?
How many more death and displaced person do there have to be to pierce the veil of our political indifference?
How many more ton of drug injected into the vein of young people worldwide must we deplore?
Must we wait until state terrorism is fully established, wait for the victory of Jihad, the application of the expansionist will of religious fanatic to the whole region, before we Members of the European Union finally agree to get involved, a is our duty?
The long offensive carried on by the Taliban, with quite open support from Pakistan, is now cutting off the people of the Northern Alliance from a supply route essential to their survival.
The international community can no longer content itself with burying it head in the sand, and conducting 'wait-and-see' diplomacy.
I think I speak for many people here when I declare our rejection of a comfortable neutrality, making a theory out of passivity and justifying blindness.
We protest at the sort of neutrality that tends to put the protagonist on the same level, stacking the daily atrocity of the Taliban regime on the same shelf a the armed resistance of Commander Massoud.
Massoud is seen a a war leader, but how could it be otherwise after so many battles?
But for those who know him and have seen him at work, he is also a man of dialogue and unification.
He see himself a the champion of a tolerant Islam.
He can be a man of peace.
Massoud insists that there is no military solution to the Afghan problem.
He is right. We must act urgently to find political solution which respect the value underpinning our Union.
That is the thrust of the resolution drafted by all the groups, which I have the honour of defending here.
Essentially it call on the Council Presidency to bring it influence to bear to put an end to foreign interference in that country.
It call on the Commission to take stock of the humanitarian aid measure intended for the Afghan population so that this aid reach everyone.
Finally it insists, and this is the essential point, that the European Union coordinate it initiative with those of neighbouring country to impose a solution whereby peace, stability, and respect for international law and the most elementary human right can be re-established.
We are well aware that this will not be an easy task, but here I would like to quote the motto of a great European, William of Orange: "Hope is not necessary to engagement, nor success to perseverance."
Mr President, Afghanistan ha the worst human right record in the world, both in term of the number and the severity of the violation committed.
The predicament of Afghan woman is a particularly apt case in point.
Women cannot go to work, girl cannot go to school, woman cannot walk freely down the street, and they are stoned, to name but a few examples.
There is not a single human right organisation working in Afghanistan.
It is the country that ha the most mines.
It is a country where there is no hope for the children.
75% of the boy and 90% of the girl do not go to school.
It is one of the poorest country and there is a forgotten war going on.
I feel this all go to show just how important this resolution is.
On balance, it is clear that the international organisation and the UN are not doing enough a matter stand.
In other words, the conflict is far more complex, there is no solution in the offing and yet, a we all agree, there is an urgent need for one.
The EU ha an important task before it in this respect.
It could bring it idea on non-military conflict management to bear.
There are a few example I could mention: the monitoring of weapon export and small arm through to the end-user, so that we do not secretly aid and abet the conflict out there, support for non-governmental organisation and women' s organisation based there, which are courageous enough to take action despite the hopelessness of the situation.
In particular, in light of the above, it is absolutely imperative that the Member States grant asylum to all those who flee Afghanistan, a a matter of course.
It would do the EU' s image no harm at all if it were to get a political initiative off the ground in the United Nations, with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.
Mr President, the recent Taliban offensive must obviously concern us.
Terrible suffering ha been caused by this conflict.
I, too, support the joint resolution, of course.
But I want to join previous speaker in emphasising two concerns.
The first issue is the position of women.
It is not something we can get used to it.
We must never trivialise it.
They still endure appalling conditions: they are denied access to work, health care and education.
They live in destitution and permanent insecurity.
They are regularly victim of stonings.
They are suppressed in the true sense of the word.
All Afghan women, whatever their age, are faced with systematic violation of their most fundamental rights.
That is why I also believe they should be entitled to the right of asylum.
The European Union must renew it solidarity with all Afghan woman in their struggle at home and abroad against the Taliban regime.
The second issue is that the Taliban are clearly seeking international recognition, on the ground that they now control virtually all of Afghanistan.
So peace, stability and respect for right can only be re-established through a political solution.
Greater involvement of the European Union is definitely needed.
And in that search, I believe it is vital for the Council to reinforce the restriction it ha decided on.
There can be no recognition by any Member State, a long a Afghanistan maintains it policy of violation of human rights, notably it systematic discrimination against women.
The Commission should also take much stronger emergency humanitarian measure for the people, doing everything possible to enable the NGOs to provide aid to Afghan woman and involve them in their activities.
Mr President, today, just a and even more so than in the past, the tragic military success of the Taliban ha meant that hundred of thousand of woman are subject to severe repression and are denied medical assistance, education, the possibility of supporting themselves and the freedom of movement.
Around a million people, most of them children, have been mutilated by anti-personnel mines.
The urgent resolution to be put to the vote today call for the concern voiced by Parliament on many occasion to be translated into further practical initiatives.
There is one point which I must stress in particular.
There ha been a budget heading for the funding of mine clearance and prevention programme for many year now.
Funding ha been allocated for 2000 and will be provided for 2001 a well.
We need to take immediate action to prevent thousand of child inadvertently triggering tragic explosion while they are playing in the fields, and receiving disabling wounds.
We can do this. The operation have been endorsed and are viable, but the funding is being held up by bureaucracy, by the need to ass previous action and by confusion over the responsibility of the different departments.
Ladies and gentleman of the Commission, look up from your texts, find out what is going on outside the realm of documents: thousand of child are in danger.
Rise above sluggishness and uncertainty.
Yes, carry out all the assessment you want to, but, in the meantime, let the fund for 2000 reach their destination and you will be saving the life and preventing the mutilation of a great many unfortunate people.
Mr President, maybe it is not useful or politically correct to point out who supported the Taliban at the start, when they were aiming to achieve the power that they now have in Afghanistan.
Other Members have already spoken of a million displaced people, a million people mutilated by landmines, thousand of woman deprived of their most basic rights, such a the right to education, health, work, or to move around freely: it must be terrible for many of these women, who are accustomed to education, to a secular way of life, to be confined to that area with no freedom.
And we do need to take this into account in the European institutions, a well a the fact that drug cultivation is used to buy arms.
This morning - and I will shortly conclude, Mr President - a code of conduct wa approved on the sale and trafficking of arms.
I do not think that this code will be useful unless it is effective in preventing weapon from reaching the hand of people who are committing very serious violation against human rights, a these people are.
Mr President, we all know by now that we should not entertain any illusion with regard to the nature of the present regime in Kabul.
We only have to cast our mind back to the event in Afghanistan this summer.
The Taliban launched a new military attack on their northern opponent in the middle of the worst drought this poor country ha had since time immemorial.
This drought ha resulted in a drop in harvest by an estimated 2.3 million tonne of food.
This essentially render a quarter of the total Afghan population dependent on grain supply from the World Food Programme.
It wa in just such a tragic situation that the country' s radical Islamic ruler revolted against the UN' s so-called bread programme in the capital of Kabul.
This wa a project that wa due to benefit 28 000 war widows, no less.
The Taliban' s excuse?
There are countless bakery which offer employment to women.
Despite this - at least in western eye - inhumane policy, the Taliban is seeking international diplomatic recognition.
They seize on cooperation in the return of million of Afghan refugees, sponsored by the United Nations, a official global acceptance of their unbearable tyranny.
It remains very much to be seen whether this religious barbarism is really sufficient for u to form a closed international containment front against the host of Jihad conspirator, Osama bin Laden.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, the current intensification in the armed conflict between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance is extremely disturbing.
Increasing number of people are fleeing from the fighting.
Some source put the number of displaced people at 90 000.
Many of these are now seeking sanctuary in makeshift camp in the mountain in the north-east of the country.
The condition there could go badly downhill when winter set in.
In the light of this development, ECHO, the Commission agency for humanitarian aid, is currently working hard to put together a package of emergency aid to the value of EUR 3 million, in order to support these displaced people with medical supplies, food, and the mean to get through the winter.
In addition, ECHO ha already made EUR 5.7 million available this year for the victim of drought in Afghanistan, for mine clearance in the north of the country and for the resettlement of refugees.
The victim of drought are also due to receive a further EUR 3 million.
I would like to take the opportunity to say, in response to Mrs Paciotti' s comment, that naturally I will not hesitate to inquire within the Commission today a to what ha become of the funding for mine clearance and what is going to become of it.
Should I find that there are bureaucratic stumbling block here, a you put it, then you have my word that I will do all I can to overcome these obstacle with all speed.
The honourable Members are well aware that the Commission ha a long-term commitment to the Afghan refugee and those who have been displaced within Afghanistan itself.
Between 1991 and 2000, the Commission made a total of EUR 400 million available for refugee aid, humanitarian emergency aid and food aid.
A significant slice of this wa earmarked for mine clearance and associated information campaign conducted by UN agencies, European or Afghan non-governmental organisations.
With it common position on Afghanistan, the European Union is supporting the United Nations' special mission in Afghanistan, and the effort to achieve peace undertaken by the General Secretary' s special representatives.
The Union ha resolved to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and stability in the country, and it is a plain a day that this will not come about until human right and fundamental value are given full recognition.
Accordingly, the common position roundly condemns the ongoing discrimination against woman in Afghanistan and other human right violation that take place there.
As long a the Taliban leadership continues to be a ambiguous in it statement on opium cultivation a it ha been hitherto, the Commission refuse to support any anti-drugs project in Afghanistan.
That said, it will give staunch support to the neighbouring countries, so a to improve their chance of tackling the drug problem.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.
Human right
The next item is the joint debate on the following motion for resolutions:
B5-0794/2000, by Mr Medina Ortega, Mr Linkohr and Mr Fava, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiation with the guerillas;
B5-0795/2000, by Mr Di Piandro, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the kidnap of Father Alejandroi Matos Castro in Colombia;
B5-0796/2000, by Mr Marset Campos, Mr Miranda and Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on kidnaps, abductions, and the peace process in Colombia;
B5-0797/2000, by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the kidnap in Colombia of a Spanish Jesuit engaged in negotiation with the guerillas.
Mr President, I am speaking to confirm the agreement of the various political group that have tabled a motion for a resolution on the kidnapping of a Spanish Jesuit in Colombia and to inform the House that we have decided to withdraw it in view of the fact that the person ha been freed.
Two other Community citizen have also been freed today.
Therefore, I am not going to discus the draft resolution, a it no longer exists.
Nevertheless, Colombia is clearly a country that deserves our attention.
But a Mr Linkohr wa saying, the problem with Latin America is that we only concern ourselves with these country when there are problems.
I think this is a good time to highlight the need for the European Union to draw up a comprehensive policy on Latin America which could perhaps prevent these country from regularly going through the crisis situation that some of them have experienced.
Mr President, I would like to reaffirm what my colleague, Manuel Medina, ha just said.
Fortunately, in this particular case, we can welcome the fact that the Spanish Jesuit and other Spaniards, a well a other Community citizens, have been released.
It is also true, however, that Colombia, which we frequently discus here, ha several problems.
At the moment, for example, there is a Colombian priest, Oliveiro Medina, who is in Brazil.
His extradition to Colombia could put his life in danger because we have already seen, in the last resolution on Colombia that we discussed, that more than 24 human right defender have recently been murdered there.
Unfortunately, we all hoped that we would not have to discus Colombia again.
Unfortunately, we may have to discus it again, but I think that the European Union should have a fundamental role - a Manolo Medina wa saying - in Latin America in general.
And reducing budget for Latin America is not going to help u to play the role that we should be playing there.
Mr President, I would like to share in the happiness of my compatriot and fellow Members who have talked of their satisfaction at the freeing of the Spanish Jesuit Alejandro Matos and of other Community citizens.
We cannot forget that, in the past year, 2 075 people have been kidnapped in Colombia by the guerrillas, and we must express our concern for the violent situation that it is experiencing, particularly in the north, in the Santander region - a jungle region whose border with Venezuela is, moreover, very easily penetrated - where the constant clash between guerrilla and paramilitary are increasing, with many road block and frequent murders.
I therefore think that we should reiterate our support for a peaceful solution to the Colombian conflict, in which the action of the drug cartel have a dramatic influence.
The European Union must therefore support the initiative by President Andrés Pastrana, aimed at achieving a negotiated peace between his government and the guerrilla groups, the FAR (Revolutionary Armed Forces) and the so-called National Liberation Army.
Mr President, the issue of Colombia is something that really ha not been properly addressed in the European Union.
Even the Red Cross is leaving there because neither the paramilitary nor guerrilla respect international humanitarian law.
This highlight that the wrong approach ha been taken in relation to Colombia.
Signing peace agreement is all very well, but first and foremost we have to have respect for humanitarian law.
That is not happening there.
Not so very long ago there wa a resolution on the situation of the peace community in San José de Apartado.
That wa le than a month ago.
Since then the situation ha got even worse for the community there.
At the very least five people have been killed.
We have to address the role that the paramilitary are playing and also the role that the state is playing in this.
It really is not acceptable that people are being persecuted out of their homes, out of their land and that the world is standing idly by and letting this happen.
The state involvement ha to be addressed a well.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, the Commission, in common with Parliament, welcome the release of the Spanish Jesuit priest, Alejandro Matos Castro, last week.
We call upon the guerilla group to release the other hostages.
We urge them to eschew kidnapping in future and to respect international humanitarian law.
The Commission is deeply concerned about the escalation of violence in Colombia, particularly in respect of the massacre perpetrated recently by paramilitary force in the so-called peaceful community of San José de Apartado.
We urge the Colombian government again to investigate the precise circumstance of these crimes.
The Commission deplores the ongoing human-rights violation in Colombia and entreats the warring party to continue the peace talk and work towards a lasting peace in Colombia, based on a negotiated solution.
In this context, I would emphasise that the Commission support President Pastrana' s effort to secure peace and will do everything in it power to promote lasting peace in Colombia.
In particular, the Commission would like to have some say in the process when the European Union put together an aid package in support of the Colombian peace process.
The Commission ha already offered to coordinate the measure for a package of this kind, and is planning to approve a considerable amount of funding for this package a early a in the next few days.
Furthermore, the Commission ha proposed organising in Brussels a follow-up meeting to the Donors Conference that took place on 7 July in Madrid.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.
As several speaker have indicated, I can inform you that after good news from Colombia about the release of the Jesuit priest, and following agreement between the political groups, the motion for resolution on this issue are withdrawn.
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
The next item is the joint debate on the following motion for resolutions:
B5-0779/2000, by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members, on Macedonia;
B5-0782/2000, by Mr Haarbyr, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on Macedonia: law on higher education and universities;
B5-0786/2000, by Mrs Pack and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on FYROM: law on higher education and universities;
B5-0788/2000, by Mr Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, law on higher education and university in Macedonia.
Mr President, I just want to point out that FYROM is rather an anachronism and I invite our Greek colleagues, who always do their duty when Macedonia is on the agenda, to intervene perhaps a little more firmly with their government and supersede this situation, which frankly border on the ridiculous.
Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, I think this resolution is important because it refers to a positive decision by the Macedonian government, and unfortunately not by all the political force of Macedonia, on the law on higher education which will at last allow young people from minorities, in particular the Albanian minority, to study in their mother tongue.
I think we should congratulate Mr Georgievsky, the Prime Minister, and Mr Xhaferi, leader of the Albanian party in the government majority, who are behind this law on higher education. Unfortunately, it wa not supported by the parliamentary opposition.
It is regrettable that, at the request of the Socialist Group in particular, the text of the resolution doe not mention their names, and I would like to point out to our Socialist friend that their request, made in the name of a more general principle that political force should not be cited, strike me a rather unreliable given that, looking at the motion for a resolution on the Middle East we are going to vote on today, we are frankly dealing with very specific situation and very specific players.
So, once again, we have double standard and I think that is deplorable.
I call on the Commission to monitor this issue very closely.
It will take a great deal of money to establish the university.
This is a practical way of supporting a project which could help overcome the problem of two large, differing population living side by side, and this is an area where monitoring by the Commission is crucial.
Mr President, I would like to take up what Mr Dupuis had to say.
I believe that when the audience in the stand see ARYM up there, they will actually think this refers to a different country.
ARYM mean Ancienne République Yougoslave de Macédoine, i.e the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Quite simply, that mean 'Macedonia' .
The dispute about the name is a dispute between Greece and the country of Macedonia.
Of course we all hope - and that includes the Greek MEPs here - that this dispute will soon be settled.
We have seen how the difficult situation in Macedonia ha steadily worsened where the treatment of the Albanians is concerned.
All of those who, for a long time now, have been going in and out of this country, have kept up the pressure for this problem to be resolved.
However, I would also stress that this problem is nothing new: it is the legacy of the Yugoslav period, when the Albanians were always discriminated against, including those in Macedonia.
Unfortunately, it was, of course, the case that the problem wa not resolved under the last government, in the run-up to 1998.
Therefore, we are all delighted that a genuinely sound solution is perhaps at last to be found to this problem of higher education.
The illegal foundation of Tetovo university many year ago produced great tension in Macedonia, which I am sorry to say, could not be defused over the past few years.
We owe a duty of care to the student to ensure that this problem is resolved. After all, these student had, or have, diploma that serve no purpose in the outside world.
Therefore, I believe we owe it to the young people to find a solution to the problem, and have now paved the way to this end.
As a delegation, we have always insisted that a solution should be found to this problem.
Now at last we have found it.
Not us, but the government under Prime Minister Georgievski, and also the Albanian leader, Xhaferi, and above all, the representative of the Council of Europe, Max van der Stoel.
This outstanding cooperation ha led to a draft bill, which wa adopted by the majority in Parliament.
In common with Olivier Dupuis, I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition party - which formed part of the government up until 1998 and could have resolved the problem - have closed their mind to this draft bill without offering a better solution themselves.
I am particularly at a loss to understand the behaviour of the Albanian opposition party, which ha deliberately closed it mind to the necessary solution to the Albanian problem in Macedonia.
The fact that the Socialist opposition refused to support this must have been against their better judgement, but that sometimes happens with the opposition, and not just in Macedonia.
We are now awaiting the necessary aid for the transformation of Tetovo university into a private university whose diploma will then be recognised.
All those who want to see an improvement in the inter-ethnic relation in Macedonia, in the interest of stabilisation, must now do their bit to help solve this problem and ensure that a private university actually becomes a reality.
That is what this urgent procedure is all about today.
People from different ethnic background must be able to live together in Macedonia.
This could provide a good role model for the neighbouring country and help to stabilise the entire region.
Mr President, it make a nice change in this Parliament to be able to reflect on positive development in south-eastern Europe, and very often the subject is Macedonia where, despite all the problem this country ha to deal with, the two largest group of the population co-exist in peace, even form a coalition government and have now adopted a new act on higher education.
That is a breakthrough on an issue which ha caused a great deal of problem for a long time.
At long last, the Albanians now have the opportunity to attend university course in their own language and within the official education system of Macedonia.
That is a real step forward for Macedonia.
As far a I am concerned, it prof to all neighbouring country that education doe not only have to spread hatred, a is often the case these days, but that it can also serve a a cradle for a peaceful, multi-ethnic society.
That is a development which, in my view, deserves unqualified support from the European Union.
Finally, I would like to spend a moment on something which, normally speaking, I do not think belongs in a European Parliament, namely the role of a fellow countryman.
I am proud of the fact, that this time round, the role of Mr Max van der Stoel, the High Representative for minority of the OSCE, ha proved crucial in this issue.
Mr President, I would like to echo Mr Lagendijk' s praise of Mr Van der Stoel.
I believe it is extremely important for the outside world to send positive vibe to Macedonia.
That doe not mean to say that the Macedonian people are not sufficiently alert themselves to be able to deliver something in this area.
The former President, Mr Gligorov, wa already a shining example of non-ethnic thinking, and the new President, too, ha gained the trust of all group of the population in Macedonia.
In my view, it is an extraordinary achievement on the part of the Macedonians to be able to settle the issue within their own borders.
It appears to me that cooperation between Slavonic Macedonians and especially Albanian-speaking Macedonians is an extremely important topic which could manifest itself in the fight over the important initiative to establish a university in Tetovo.
This initiative ha been on the card for year and still there is no talk of official recognition.
Fortunately, this initiative is now being backed by a parliamentary majority, a a result of which a key problem in the inter-ethnic relation ha been solved, not only because it is so important to teach in Albanian at the universities, but especially because it considerably enhances the social position of the Albanian-speaking Macedonians.
It attracts a new class of student to higher education.
It is also significant in term of the presence of Albanian speaker in the official apparatus, a presence which is currently lagging far behind what should actually be the case.
It appears to me that the recognition of degree from Tetovo university is a major step forward.
In time, the university should also be funded by taxpayers' money only. After all, the Albanian speaker pay tax and are just a entitled to a share when it come to paying for education.
I, myself, wa educated at a university which wa a 'Free University' , free from church and state influence, yet government-funded.
I have to say that I still believe this to be a great bonus and it also prof that the state respect the country' s own particular educational sphere.
The outside world should do all it can to help the Albanian speaker integrate in their country.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, my group proposes to support the present motion, which we have also signed, because I believe it is right for the European Union to support the solution that ha been found in Macedonia and which accommodates the Albanian population.
I would have preferred it if we could have found a solution that all the party in Parliament could have voted for.
We would rather leave it to the Macedonians to discus where the process broke down, Mrs Pack.
I have it on good authority that they were only trivial issues, and that the government could have accommodated the opposition in this respect.
I do not know.
I do not think that is the be-all and end-all.
What matter most is that a solution is found which we can all subscribe to.
Even though this notion is unpopular in this House - indeed the prevailing mood is the smaller the unit, the more divided the systems, and the more separatist the movements, the better - I would like to make the point here, which is one we have also discussed at some length in the delegation with our counterpart from Macedonia, that we must be clear about the fact that their own Albanian-language institution should help to promote social cohesion in Macedonia and not create divisions.
That is an important aspect we should not lose sight of.
Mr President, General De Gaulle spoke of the "paix de braves" i.e. the peace of the brave, in the era of Franco-German reconciliation, by which he meant that patriot on both side had been able to achieve a lasting settlement.
That is exactly what ha happened in Macedonia.
Therefore, I also believe that this reconciliation is sustainable, but that the government, which ha very courageously found a solution to the university issue and to many other issues, need visible sign of it success, and powerful support, else peace throughout the region will be under threat.
That is why it is so important, firstly, to find a solution to the name problem.
When Greece, of all countries, again put forward a proposal to call it Slavo-Macedonia, it really is asking for trouble, because that is precisely what the Albanians would regard a being another example of exclusion tactics.
Secondly, I take the view that it is very important to quickly bring the stabilisation agreement to a successful conclusion, and thirdly, I believe that it is very important to support Macedonia a a role model in the region, so that it ha a stabilising effect on it neighbouring countries. It is also imperative for free, country-wide election to be held a soon a possible in Kosovo, in order to ensure that force with unequivocal democratic legitimacy come to power there - and not just at local level - which will truly have the interest of the Kosovo Albanians at heart.
I am sure this would defuse no small number of problem in Macedonia, too.
I feel Macedonia ha every chance of becoming a type of Switzerland of the South-East, and we should give it massive support on this journey, and reject anything that could lead to a relapse into nationalism and chauvinism, which, I am sorry to say, certain force in the country are currently trying to provoke for tactical reasons.
Mr President, no one can deny that what ha been achieved in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over the last eight year is nothing short of a miracle; not only ha this tiny country managed to keep out of the armed conflict in the region, it ha also made serious effort to modernise it economy and society, set up democratic institution and respect human right and the right of minorities.
Without doubt, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is helping enormously to promote peace and security in the region and we trust that the last problem in it relation with Greece will shortly be resolved in a way which respect the dignity of both countries.
I welcome with the utmost satisfaction the new law on higher education, which will create the condition needed for the Albanian-speaking community to set up a private university.
I am convinced that this tiny country in the Balkans deserves the undivided support of the European Union and I trust that an association and stability agreement will be signed before the end of the French Presidency.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, I am sure we are all agreed that the stability and even long-term viability of Macedonia is dependent on Macedonians and Albanians being able, in the long run, to live together in peace there, and it is therefore in the interest of Europe to provide all the support we can in order to strengthen this peaceful coexistence and make it a lasting proposition.
That is why the Commission ha repeatedly urged the Macedonian Government to resolve the outstanding problem of higher education in the Albanian language.
The Commission welcome the passing of the new law.
The Commission is working with the OSCE High Commissioner for national minorities, Max van der Stoel, with a view to providing financial support for the implementation of this important law.
Perhaps I could use this opportunity to say that the cooperation between the Commission and the High Commissioner, Mr van der Stoel, ha already got off to a good start.
Our combined effort have enabled u to solve a similar problem that existed in two other European countries, i.e. Estonia and Latvia, and I am grateful to be able to take this opportunity to say that our cooperation with the OSCE High Commissioner in this respect ha been extremely constructive and valuable.
I believe the same will apply to Macedonia.
The Commission is intending to make EUR 1 million available for the current year, under the national programme for Macedonia, in order to support the implementation of this law.
The funding allocation is provided for in the financing proposal which is to be put forward today - possibly this very hour - to the PHARE administration committee.
If the Member States adopt this financing proposal, a financing agreement will be concluded with the government and a detailed project will be drawn up in close cooperation with Mr van der Stoel in the coming weeks.
The PHARE funding made available for the year 2000 under the national programme could also be used to support the university in the coming academic year, i.e. in 2001 and 2002.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.
Samina ferry disaster in Greece
The next item is the joint debate on the following motion for resolutions:
B5-0783/2000, by Mr Katiforis and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the sinking of the Greek ferry;
B5-0787/2000, by Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the sinking of the vessel 'Express Samina' ;
B5-0791/2000, by Mr Korakas and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the sinking of the vessel 'Express Samina' .
Mr President, Commissioner, all the political group have now agreed to debate this issue and have tabled a joint resolution. I think this is extremely important, a is the fact that the Socialists have changed their initial position, because the sinking of the Express Samina ha not only shocked Greece, it ha shocked the whole of Europe.
We are not debating here merely in order to express our sorrow; the main subject of our debate is what happened, why it happened and how we can rectify the situation, how the Commission and the European Parliament can help from now on to ensure that the same doe not happen again in the future.
There can be no doubt that the human factor played a decisive part.
However, there are aspect of the accident which, in my view, prove that Community law ha been infringed.
The directive on the registration of passenger wa infringed.
The Minister ha admitted a much, the Prime Minister admitted a much yesterday in Parliament and I hope that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will admit a much.
The directive on life-saving equipment, life-jackets and life-rafts wa infringed.
Mr President, on Sunday, three hour before the deadline for applying Directive 98/18 expired, some 50 Greek ship were taken out of service by the Ministry of Merchant Marine.
What amazes me is that the Government and the company both insist that the Express Samina complied with all the safety requirements.
In other words, had it not sunk, it would still be sailing.
The government itself say so.
So what are we calling for? We are calling mainly for three things.
Firstly, full application of Directive 98/41 on the registration of passengers. Secondly, a shorter timetable for Directive 98/18 so that there are no longer any derogation for Member States, a ha been the case to date with Greece.
Parliament consented at second reading under pressure from the Greek government at the time.
Mr Stenmark remembers and can testify to this. And, of course, we are calling for an end to the derogation for Greece on cabotage, the monopoly and oligopoly arrangement governing transport by sea.
Greek cabotage operator are running their new ship on the route to Italy, where there is competition, and their old ship on the Greek routes, where there is no competition, and that is how safety standard drop.
I should like to point out that all the Greek MEPs have now reacted against this situation.
We do not consider that everything is a mess in Greece; there are some very good ship and the overwhelming majority of Greek seaman are very good at their job.
We have tabled the motion a an expression of our awareness of the issue and our intention to fight for Greece to adopt even higher safety standard than the European Union in order to correct this negative impression of our country.
Three amendment have been proposed by the GUE/NGL Group, one on shipping registers, one on working condition and one on an in situ investigation by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
We disagree mainly on technical grounds, which I do not have time to go into now, but would be happy to explain privately to my fellow Members.
The problem are technical rather than political: for example, a far a shipping register are concerned, the resolution already contains a reference to them and there is no need to repeat it.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, we voted against a resolution on the sinking of the Express Samina under the urgent procedure the other day because a judicial inquiry is already under way in Greece and the Greek Government had already made a number of statement on what need to be done.
We feel that the word of the European Parliament need weight if it is to be more than passing comment.
Besides, our Parliament doe the same every time a sad incident such a this happens. Must it continue to do so?
Someone said in the House the other day that we do not want to debate shipping safety.
But ha there ever been or will there ever be an in-depth debate in 2 or 3 minute under the urgent procedure?
In deference to the House' s decision the other day, we sat round the table and thrashed out a joint text which, I admit, wa only made possible by the cooperation and good faith of all the groups.
This final text express our sorrow, which wa expressed at the start by our President, Mrs Fontaine, and take account of the statement by the Commission and the call on the Greek Government for full information and a full investigation, which ha already begun. It also stress the importance of applying safety regulation and our scepticism about all form of derogation.
But, surely, this is precisely what our proactive Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is doing and - a we all know - it need serious and often time-consuming dialogue and procedure in order to decide what need to be done on each occasion.
Is it that easy to decide what need to be done about shipping under an urgent procedure?
Nor wa the need for urgent procedure justified after the event, given that the compromise text contains no reference which might have been misunderstood a urgent party politics against the Greek Government, precisely a the result of the good faith which, a I have said, wa demonstrated on all sides.
So the question remains. What have we gained from the text which would have been lost had the resolution not been urgent?
Be that a it may, Mr President, we have agreed to this joint proposal for a resolution, which we support a it stands, urgently, and we of course disagree with the amendment tabled, again urgently, for the reason which I have stated.
And a far a shipping is concerned, in deference to the memory of the innocent victim of the Express Samina, we shall support and take the lead in any action which target personal safety and environmental protection and try to do more than just make an impression.
Mr President, that I personally am saddened and angered by the sinking and on behalf of it victim doe without saying, although I suppose that we shall never completely do away with accident at sea and shipwrecks. But what really irritates and anger me are shortcomings, imperfections, derogation and the problem which this sinking ha brought to light and that is why we need to debate them;
I do not know if it will be under the urgent procedure but, in essence, it must be a quickly a possible. And they do not only concern Greece.
We need to debate and to call, a we do in the resolution, for the absolute application - with no derogation - of Community legislation, which is inadequate and need to be enriched; we need to call for and encourage modernisation and improvement in port infrastructures, crew training in modern equipment, crew which, I should like to add, Mr President, are among the most experienced in the world.
Of course, we also need to reorganise and refine administrative monitoring, control and sanctioning procedures.
Mr Papoutsis ha already "dismantled" a very important directorate in his ministry, the Directorate of Merchant Ship Surveys.
It is only a very small first step, I know, and other step are needed.
And because all this concern Greece, which ha the biggest shipping sector in the European Union, it basically concern the safety of all type of shipping throughout the Union.
Which is why we are impatient to receive the recent decision finally taken by the Council and we are impatient to receive them in legislative form in Parliament also, which is why we feel that it would be useful if a parliamentary committee were to go to Greece and work with the authorities, agency and professional to see where the difficulty lie - it is the most experienced country when it come to shipping - so that it can assist the European Parliament in helping to improve, enhance and introduce stricter legislation for the safety of shipping throughout Europe.
Mr President, I too shall, of course, start by expressing my deepest sorrow and solidarity with the family of the victim and with those who survived along with the memory of their terrifying ordeal.
Of course, accident at sea happen, human error are made; but what is most important, Mr President, is for u to see, when a human error is made, if the right action wa taken before and after the error.
In other words, in the present case, if the right inspection were carried out and the right certificate issued for the ship, if the life-jackets were in the right places, if the crew wa doing it job.
There is a whole series of thing which need looking at right away, especially if Community legislation wa also infringed.
In my view, the Greek competition committee ha never acted in case in which it should have acted.
Of course, I know it is not a matter for the Commission, because the Commission act in case of competition at European Union level, but my question is this: how is it possible for a competition committee appointed by the Minister, a committee already in place, to have done nothing and to gradually have allowed a shipping monopoly to emerge?
And, a we know, monopolies, be they private or state monopolies, are a bad thing. In the present case they are bad for both freight and passenger shipping.
It seems to me that the factor which need to be quantified here a the result of this tragic incident, is what need to be done at European Union level, because the bigger picture is the safety of shipping in the European Union.
I should like to say, a far a the resolution is concerned, because there are a number of amendments, that my amendment on shipping register is covered in the text, it is already there.
As far a my amendment on working condition is concerned, there is a directive on this and the wording of the amendment is le satisfactory than the text.
And finally, the visit by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is not, I think, the answer to our prayers; it is up to the European Commission to investigate and ascertain if a Community directive ha been infringed, to hurry up with the case law which we want to see in order to make shipping safer and, finally, to do whatever need to be done and, a I said, to investigate the matter of this famous competition committee.
That is what we are waiting to hear from the European Commission.
Mr President, I too would like to express my deepest condolence to the family of those killed tragically in this ferry disaster, but also pay tribute to those involved in the rescue effort, not least of course, the Royal Navy.
On behalf of the Socialist transport team, I regret the fact that this debate is taking place a an urgency.
It could be more properly debated in committee next week, but that wa the decision of the House which, of course, I respect.
What we certainly do not need today, or indeed next week, or in the future, is a point-scoring exercise between our Greek colleague in the run-up to the general election in Greece.
That serf no one's interest.
This is not a concern solely for Greece.
It is a matter for Europe a a whole.
This wa an accident waiting to happen.
Some of u have worked on the issue of ferry safety for many years, not least because other ferry in other part of Europe have also sunk with a tragic loss of life, be it the Herald of Free Enterprise, the Scandinavian Star or, of course, most notoriously of all, the Estonia in the 1990s.
All these demonstrate that ferry are not safe enough.
In our view, this tragedy could well happen again.
Not because we have too few law in Europe, but because the law are not properly enforced.
It is not just Greece.
There are other Member States that do not comply with maritime safety law and if I may, I will name some: Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Presidency, France, are all failing to implement the port-state control directive.
I hope today, and in the coming day and weeks, we will hear from the Commission on what action they propose to take against these Member States that do not take maritime safety seriously.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to join the name of my own group in expressing sympathy and solidarity with the family of the deceased and the survivor of the shipwreck and gratitude also to those involved in the rescue operations.
It is human nature to be the more affected by a tragedy the closer it come to one.
If I speak with special feeling in this debate, it is because over the year Greece ha become another home to me.
I have had many opportunity during this time to observe just how skilful Greek seamanship can be.
But the issue cannot be localised in this way.
In recent year many other life have been lost at sea in our waters, not only by way of major ferry disaster but, on all too frequent a basis, from amongst our fishing communities.
That is why we have to address issue of maritime safety more generally and in the constructive way suggested in this motion.
I, too, would put particular stress on the need to implement properly the legislation we already have.
I would ask that we become even more cautious than we ever have been before about allowing derogation from future legislation where matter of safety are concerned.
Nor are such issue important only for those of u who come from area where the sea is our highway or our place of work.
They are important for u all, even when we are not immediately affected.
This is so, if only because, in the word of the early English poet, John Donne, any man's death diminishes me because I am part of mankind.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I, too, should like to add our condolence to the family who have lost loved one in this tragedy.
Our thought are very much with them at this particular time.
As a Member who represents Scotland, I feel a particular sadness and concern too about these events.
Although Scotland and Greece sit at the furthest edge of the European Union, we nevertheless share a common topography.
Both our country have many island community around our shore and a such the people of Scotland's island felt a particular sense of shock following the recent event in Greece.
Our island community depend on ferry service a an absolute lifeline.
These ship provide transport for passenger and good and ensure the sustainability of some of Europe's most remote and fragile communities.
It is the duty of Member States to make sure that the owner and operator of ferry are aware of their responsibility for the safe passage of people and goods.
We are fortunate in Scotland not to have directly suffered the type of tragedy to hit Greece but we are only too well aware that our water are some of the most hazardous in Europe.
We have many concern about the forthcoming tendering process which is under way.
I should like to ask the Commission for some assurance that in tendering for lifeline ferry services, or indeed any ferry services, safety is given it highest priority.
In the cut-throat world of tendering, all too often company can be pushed into cost-cutting measure and I would not like to see safety measure being sacrificed.
It is simply not acceptable to the northern and western isle of Scotland, nor for the potential North Sea to European mainland crossing which I hope will be established in the not-too-distant future.
Our citizen deserve the best of safeguard in sea transport.
The trade union who represent the men and woman who work on ferries, a well a representative of our seaboard communities, ought to be involved in discussion at the pre-tender stage, so that they can play a role in ensuring that safe practice is not sacrificed for the sake of profit.
Mr President, allow me start by expressing by deepest sorrow and sympathy for the victim of this tragic sinking.
It ha been argued, including here in the House that the human factor wa to blame.
This argument is the least unacceptable.
The fact that the ill-fated ship wa 34 year old and wa not included on the list of ship which - and this too is wrong - were exempted from the additional inspection required under Directive 98/18/ÅC, is positive proof of the unaccountability of the shipping industry which always find a way, for which government and regulatory authority are to blame, of getting round even these generally inadequate regulations, at the expense of passenger and shipping safety.
The legal framework for shipping in Greece and in the European Union in general ha proven to be inadequate and dangerous and we need new, stricter rules, especially for very old ships, rule without derogations.
Equally dangerous is the modus operandi of the regulatory authority and the shipping register which, by operating a a private, profit-making company, is basically controlled by the very shipowner it is supposed to be controlling.
Even the tragic shipwreck ha not thrown up any useful conclusions.
On the contrary, innocent victim are being exploited in order to promote shipowners' wider objectives.
Hurrying to suspend cabotage in Greek seas, a earnestly called for, including in this joint resolution, will intensify profit-seeking competition between the shipping companies, with even more tragic consequence for passengers.
We call on the European Parliament not to approve the suspension of cabotage by rejecting the reference to it in Paragraph 5 of the joint resolution, on which our group ha requested a separate vote, and for the European Parliament to approve the involvement of crew representative in regulatory authority and shipping register and the manning of ship in line with the real need of cabotage by approving the amendment which we have tabled.
Mr President, my group would also like to express it condolence to those involved in the Samina Express disaster.
Such a disaster is always a sad event, especially if it could have been prevented.
Let u therefore hope that the inquiry into the cause can give u a clear picture of the situation, at which stage it will be possible to take adequate measures.
Judging from the survivor and those involved, we can already draw two conclusions.
Disasters at sea are often caused by a lack of maintenance and a lack of staff who are both able and aware of their responsibilities.
It is particularly tragic since this tragedy can also be put down to the lifting of EU legislation.
I am pleased that the Greek government ha now nullified this exemption.
The European Union should be very wary when granting exemption to EU legislation, particularly when public safety is at stake.
I would, in this light, refer to two other southern country that would like to join the European Union in due course.
The quality of both ship and staff under their flag is rather more notorious than renowned.
We cannot afford to make the same mistake again.
On a final note, I would just like to say that great human suffering force u to draw lesson from this tragedy.
It is unfortunate that we still have to learn the hard way.
This resolution point u in the right direction.
Mr President, a you are aware, Bavaria, more than any other German Land, ha an extraordinary affinity with Greece.
This had it effect in the 19th century, during the war of liberation.
The first Greek king wa a Bavarian, and it also ha it effect in the present day, in that a particularly large number of people from Bavaria go on holiday to this beautiful country.
There are particularly large number of Bavarian tourist in Greece.
Therefore it came a a double shock to u to have to see these terrible picture and hear this dreadful news.
It wa a shock because family suffered so badly a a result, and because we mourn the loss of human life, but it wa also a shock because it revealed a flagrant disregard for safety.
We must be aware that when something like this happens, the credibility of the European Union also come into play.
Time and again, we rightly complain that there is too much of a centralising drive in various areas.
We criticise any attempt to formulate a common European tourism policy, which some people here want.
That is something we can confidently leave to the Member States and regions.
According to the principle of subsidiarity, tourism policy is something that should be devolved to Member State level.
But what people in all country must be able to depend on in equal measure, are safety standards.
That is precisely why it is one of the European Union' s most important task to ensure that exception are no longer made where safety standard are concerned, a ha obviously been the case here.
We must be in no doubt that, particularly in an era of cross-border mass tourism, whether it be tunnel - where there wa a spate of disaster last summer - or ships, which have been involved in a great many disaster in recent years, people expect to be able to depend on safety standard within the European Union.
Human error happens all over the world.
Greek sailor are excellent and famous for being of a high standard.
But what we must realise is that when it come to technical standards, there is, I am sorry to say, a degree of chaos in this region.
This is the point at which the European Union and the European Parliament must take direct responsibility.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, the Commission share the deep sorrow and consternation felt throughout Greece over this horrendous accident.
The Commission ha expressed it sympathy to the family of the victim and the Greek government.
Unfortunately, this is not the first accident of it kind in European water and, a I am sure you know, the European Union took decisive measure after the last serious ferry accident, the Estonia disaster in 1994.
A series of far-reaching provision wa introduced in order to improve the safety of ferry passengers.
As you will recall, the purpose of the provision introduced at that time wa to ensure: first, that passenger are registered.
Secondly, that harmonised safety standard are applied, including in relation to stability and rescue equipment for inland traffic in the European Union.
Thirdly, that compulsory survey and investigation are carried out after accidents.
Fourthly, that social standard are maintained on board and, fifthly, that the shipping safety code is applied to ferry operator companies.
As a result, domestic and foreign voyage by passenger ferry to or from Union port are covered by a complete legal framework.
It is the Commission' s job to monitor the practical application of this legal framework within it remit a set out in the Treaty.
The Commission therefore contacted the Greek authority a soon a the Express Samina went down, requesting clarification of the application of Community law.
The Commission asked the Greek authority to check if the ship required to adopt the Community' s safety standard by 30 September had in fact done so.
As a result of the check requested by the Commission, 60 ship were taken out of service pending proof of compliance with standards.
The Commission fully endorses the European Parliament' s view that safety regulation applicable to passenger ferry now need to be tightened.
The Member of the Commission responsible, Vice-President De Palacio, therefore intends to include the question of revising the current directive on safety standard for passenger ferry in it work programme for 2001.
The Commission also intends to conduct a detailed examination of passenger transport liability regulations, in order to ascertain if they need to be changed.
Finally, I should like to stress that the Commission is convinced of the need to make European legislation on the safety of passenger ferry a top priority and to ensure that this legislation is applied strictly and uniformly throughout the Community.
Only thus will we contain the risk of a repeat of such accidents.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.00 p.m.
Honourable Members, we have finished the last debate and there is a short time left before the start of the debate and statement by Mr Solana, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on both the situation in the Middle East and the election in Yugoslavia.
We shall therefore take a short break.
Mr President, a you just said, the debate with Mr. Solana is not due to start for another 25 minutes, despite the fact that there are a great many urgent question which cannot now be dealt with.
We have finished early nearly every Thursday afternoon over recent weeks.
There is nothing on the agenda this evening after the vote on the Plumb report and tomorrow morning' s agenda is almost non-existent.
It seems to me that a curious discrepancy is starting to take shape.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, there were considerable delays.
Question time with the Commission started nearly one and a half hour late and yet Thursday' s agenda is disappearing before our very eyes.
The question which I wish to raise and which I would ask the Bureau to clarify is if, having done away with Fridays, certain party are now trying to do away with Thursdays.
We all know that you strongly advocate Friday sitting and you are perfectly within your right to do so.
I think your point deserves discussion.
We have taken note of it and I personally shall ensure that this aspect is discussed in detail at the next Bureau meeting.
The sitting wa suspended at 4.36 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.
Situation in the Middle East - Elections in Yugoslavia
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in the Middle East and the election in Yugoslavia.
We are delighted to welcome Mr Solana, and I shall waste no time in inviting him to speak.
Thank you, Mr Solana.
Like Mr Solana, Commissioner Verheugen will be speaking on the two issue on our agenda this afternoon, which is to say the Middle East and the election in Yugoslavia.
Afterwards the Members of Parliament who have put their name down will speak.
I think the group have arranged that they will speak on the first issue initially, and then on the second.
Madam President, High Representative, honourable Members. I agree with the High Representative' s observation on the situation in the Middle East and on the situation in Belgrade.
Allow me to start by saying a few word on Serbia.
During the election on 24 September, the Serbian people ousted Milosevic and his regime.
The Serbian people voted clearly in favour of a new beginning with new political leaders.
The European Union ha always made it clear that the Serbian people have a much right to be in Europe a any of the other people of Europe.
We have always made it clear that we would radically revise our policy towards Serbia if the Serbian people voted at the election in favour of the opposition and, hence, democratic change.
We made it clear - and I should like to reaffirm this - that any decision in favour of democratic change would also be a decision to return to Europe.
There is not the shadow of a doubt that this message wa heard in Serbia and the Serbian people have cast their vote.
The victory ha been won, although the regime ha made and continues to make huge effort to forestall it.
The question of whether democratic change can now be introduced and if it can be introduced without violence will perhaps be decided in the next few hour on the street of Belgrade.
Allow me to say loud and clear: Europe unreservedly support the democratic opposition in Serbia.
We call for the voice of the Serbian people to be heard and respected and we share it burning desire to see the back of Milosevic and his cohorts, who have brought so much suffering and unhappiness to so many, both in Serbia and in several other countries.
As soon a the will of the people is respected - and it will be, of that I have no doubt - what ha happened in Serbia will create an opportunity for real, lasting peace in the Balkans.
It will give the Serbian people the chance to rejoin the European family of nation and to build a peaceful and stable future together with it neighbours.
If the Serbian people bring about democratic change - and the European Union promised this a long time ago - the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will enjoy the same benefit a it neighbour and the European Union will maintain the same relation with it.
We must be prepared to keep this promise a soon a the will of the people is respected.
As Mr Solana ha already indicated - and I can confirm that the Commission is already working on reconstruction aid for the Serbian economy and infrastructure - this aid will come to fruition a soon a a democratic government is in office.
We are prepared to lift sanction and provide emergency aid against the harsh winter conditions.
The President of the Commission commented last week that this is an immense task which we must tackle immediately and without delay, a soon a the will of the people is respected.
I think that the signal which this debate sends to Belgrade today will be decisive.
The message which Parliament must send can only be to urge Milosevic one more time, perhaps for the last time, to see the writing on the wall, step down and pave the way for democratic change in Serbia.
(Applause)
I should like to make a few comment on the dramatic and rapid development in the Middle East.
We feel deep sorrow and sympathy for the numerous victims.
It is mainly Palestinians who have fallen victim to the conflict which have re-ignited over the last few days.
We cannot be harsh enough in condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force.
We condemn any action which deserves to be seen a provocation, especially in connection with the holy site in Jerusalem.
We welcome and support the effort being made by President Chirac, President Mubarak and Secretary of State Albright and can only hope that the supreme objective of ending the violence and restoring peace and order will be achieved.
On the question of the committee of enquiry, the Commission support the Presidency' s stance.
Obviously, this crisis may have dangerous repercussion on the peace process.
We share this concern.
Nonetheless - and I take the same view here a Mr Solana - it would be premature to consider that agreement between Israel and Palestine is now out of the question.
The window of opportunity will be open until the end of October.
After that, the stability of Prime Minister Barak' s government will be in jeopardy and there will be tremendous pressure on President Arafat to declare statehood.
I hope that the meeting between President Mubarak, President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak in Sharm el Sheik will mark a return to constructive negotiation on a lasting peace agreement.
It is our job to convince Israel that recognising and respecting the right of the Palestinians, with all the compromise which that implies, is the best way of safeguarding it long-term national interests.
Israel' s long-term interest lie in lasting peace.
We must convince the Palestinians that the best way of achieving their objective and safeguarding their right is to negotiate with Israel.
I should like to reaffirm that the European Union support the peace process because it is the only mechanism which can make the only possible alternative for Israel and the Palestinian people come true.
Fair, comprehensive peace, even if it mean painful compromise on both sides.
However complicated the issue may be, the party must grab the historic chance which they now have.
Anything else would be an awful tragedy.
Negotiations should build on the progress made in Camp David in July.
This progress wa not directly tangible, to be sure, because the summit a a whole wa not successful.
But nor wa Camp David a failure, because the gulf between the party wa clearly narrowed and some serious taboo were overcome.
The European Union' s stand on the substance of the peace process ha not changed.
We support the party in negotiating an agreement in keeping with the principle and reference of the peace process set in motion in Madrid.
We are convinced that a compromise can be found on all the point at issue.
We are also prepared to make a contribution and provide help.
If, a we hope, the party manage to conclude an agreement, the European Union will add it political and financial support to the effort being made by others on the basis of a fair distribution of the burden and will meet the parties' demand to a reasonable extent.
We are prepared to work on securing stability in the region and, in the long term, on safeguarding the permanent welfare of the region through sustainable economic growth and an improved standard of living, so that the people in the region can reap the benefit of peace.
This philosophy is in complete accord with a stronger Barcelona Europe-Mediterranean process and we shall continue our effort within the context of that process.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I take part in this debate with certain reservation because I do not want this Parliament giving the impression that it is sitting in judgment, casting anathema on this or that person when, after such great hope were raised here only a month ago, we face the dramatic consequence of this new explosion of violence in the Middle East.
I have agreed to be spokesperson for the Group of the European People' s Party because, like my colleague in the group, I think it is essential to ask the Council, the Commission and you, Mr Solana, to spare no effort - you have just committed yourself to that - to help restart negotiation to secure the peace so long awaited throughout the world, in Europe, but especially there, on the spot.
I know from experience that it is a lot more difficult for an army to win peace than a war.
I know that the transition from fighting to peacekeeping requires troop who are capable, not of unleashing violence from their weapon in the conquest of an objective, but of controlling that violence.
That requires special training, standard now for soldier in European Union armies, because we are lucky enough to be at peace.
The force of Israel and Palestine are not so lucky.
It is up to u to take our place beside the United Nations and the United States of America and, in close cooperation with them, to continue tirelessly supporting all those who have the determination to succeed at the price of the necessary concessions.
And I have one question, Mr Solana: surely the time ha come for an intelligent and courageous initiative by the European Union on the status of Jerusalem?
We all know that is the crux of the matter and we have not forgotten the interesting proposal we have heard on this subject in this very Chamber, which deserve our support.
Madam President, I want to begin by expressing my deep sympathy with those family who have been affected by the latest bloody event that have taken place in the area we are talking about.
Like others, I also want to express my concern about what is happening and, at the same time, say that, whenever this area is talked about, the impression given is really one of crossing a minefield and of it not taking very much to provoke a reaction, almost no matter what is said.
I too, however, must urge both the Commissioner and Mr Solana to do everything in their power to press for the successful achievement of a ceasefire agreement, so that the bloody event in question might be brought to an end.
If that doe not happen, a chain reaction might be triggered, in other country too, which might prove to be uncontrollable.
A minor example of this is the event that took place yesterday in Copenhagen when a peaceful demonstration turned violent. Happily, no-one wa killed a a result, but unfortunately a number of people were injured.
What we in the EU must and shall do, therefore, is continue talking in term of negotiation, negotiation and, again, negotiation, so that those window which are now open do not close before we have achieved a result.
A peace agreement is needed now. Otherwise, there is a strong possibility of thing ending in disaster.
Madam President, my contribution today is not based on all kind of theoretical analysis but on my own experience over the past week, because I happened to be in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the disturbance took place.
On that basis, I would like to make three observations.
Firstly, I would like to comment on Mr Sharon' s provocation on Thursday.
It wa clear from the outset that the issue wa one of internal party-politics, namely the battle between Sharon and Netanyahu.
In my view, what is far more damaging is the fact that this provocation wa condoned by Prime Minister Barak, who, in my view, either made the huge mistake of wrongly gauging the implication of Mr Sharon' s visit, or made a conscious attempt to bring the whole situation to a head.
Secondly, I would like to turn to the disturbance at the Al Aqsa Mosque on Friday.
The next day, I talked to various people who visited that Mosque and it is really incomprehensible that various men in their fifty and sixty - i.e. not those throwing the stone - were shot at in the Mosque.
Talking of provocation, I find it extremely shocking that the Israeli Government should shoot people who were praying in the Mosque on Temple Mount on the Holy Day of the Muslims, and I believe that the international community wa entirely justified in it condemnation of the incident.
My final comment concern a visit to the hospital in Eastern Jerusalem the next day. In fact, I have quite a few observation regarding that visit.
I found it extremely shocking to see that during the disturbances, an ambulance driver wa shot.
In another incident which I witnessed with my own eyes, an ambulance driver wa shot in the foot from a ten centimetre range a he wa trying to come to the rescue of some people. The most shocking of all is the fact that the Israeli police and the army used fragmentation bullets.
These are bullet which, upon contact with the body, shatter into dozen of pieces. They are banned internationally, even in battle amongst soldiers; yet they are now used against citizens.
My conclusion is that the Israeli Government ha applied excessive force which ha been widely condemned, and rightly so.
My question to Mr Solana and the Commission is the following: what could the European Union do in very concrete term in order, first of all, to substantiate the international inquiry into these disturbances, and secondly, to bring the peace process back on track?
Madam President, Mohamed wa one of the many baby killed by the Israeli army. Eight year on from the signing of the peace agreements, the army still occupies over 80 % of the territories.
The settler have opened fire.
How can we describe these new massacre and this Palestinian rebellion.
More stone-throwing youths?
It is more than that.
The Palestinian security force are also firing.
The explosion had been brewing for months: it is difficult to believe in peace when you consider that the number of settler ha grown from 141 000 to over 200 000 since the signing of the peace agreements; when you cannot find work to support your children, which is the case of my friend Talal who work a a builder in the settlements, maybe even on the land which used to belong to his family; it is difficult when the soldier stop you from moving around.
Ariel Sharon wa the catalyst but the responsibility also lie with the government which allowed him to visit the holy site and did not stop the soldier firing on the crowd.
While condemning all form of violence, we cannot make any parallel between the Israeli violence and the Palestinian violence.
On the one hand, there is a state and an army occupying a territory in breach of all international law and, on the other, there is a people who is tired of suffering and humiliation.
This is not the work of Hamas: it is the uprising of a people who have had enough of being oppressed and are not being given satisfaction even by their own leader and decision-makers.
It is the revolt of the Palestinians who live in Israel who are not only demonstrating their solidarity with their brother but demanding to be treated a citizen with full right and to be allowed to live free from discrimination in Israel.
We must play our part in bringing the violence to an end and re-establishing negotiations: the fighting must cease, the Israeli soldier must be withdrawn, there must be an international inquiry, at which Europe must be present, and the Palestinian people must be protected.
It would be enough for the European Union and the UN to make it clear that the UN resolutions, starting with resolution 338, 242 and 194 on the return of refugee to their homes, apply.
This would in itself have a major impact and could change Israel's - by now - firm conviction that it can always do whatever it like with impunity.
The right of the State of Israel to exist and to security is very important to us, a are the Israelis themselves who, together with the Palestinians, are currently demonstrating that they have had enough of occupation and enough of this violence.
But the right of the Palestinian State are no le important.
In my opinion, Europe can and must do a great deal in this direction, and it must be clear and resolute.
It is true that peace is achieved through dialogue but right have to be respected, and here right are not being respected.
It is not a question of the Israelis making concessions; we must enforce the law.
Madam President, the bloody confrontation which have taken place in the last few day in Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Israel are particularly serious, because of the high number of victim and also because they have brought renewed talk of exclusion a regard the State of Israel, talk that we thought belonged to the past and which is dangerously irresponsible.
The violence, the unacceptable provocation, the disproportionate reaction against the Palestinian people must not become a pretext for questioning the fundamental right of both peoples, Israeli and Palestinian, to have a state to ensure expression of their nationhood.
Some of the statement that have been made - here, even, and elsewhere - are disturbing.
They are not likely to make negotiation any easier, quite the contrary.
The event of the last few day demonstrate exactly how fragile the peace process is.
So we must do everything possible to douse the fire a quickly a possible.
The only effective way of doing that is through intergovernmental talk and Mr Solana, who ha just left us, is right to concentrate his effort in that direction.
And here I want to pay homage to the resolute diplomacy of the United States, France and Egypt in particular.
The main lesson to be drawn from these grave troubles, the source of which ha been Jerusalem, and more specifically the Temple Mount and the Al Aqsa Mosque Compound, is that a long a the negotiation on Jerusalem and in particular on the Holy Places are put off, peace cannot be definitely assured.
It is absolutely essential to end the dangerous deadlock where each side considers it unthinkable that the other should have sovereignty over the Holy Places.
So, negotiation should concentrate on the possibility of making the most sensitive area neutral, and why not revive the proposal made here on 2 September by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Mr Ahmed Qurie?
As you will remember, he told u that the major difference over Jerusalem lay at the heart of the failure of Camp David, and made the following proposal, with particular reference to UN Resolution 181, and I quote: "we Palestinians agree that both part of Jerusalem, East and West, should be a unified Jerusalem, an international Jerusalem, and it should not be the capital of Israel and Palestine alone, but of the whole world." .
I think this avenue ought to be explored a soon a possible, because until the Jerusalem question is resolved, it will continue to be the source of periodic confrontation likely to degenerate in the same way a the tragic event we are currently witnessing.
Madam President, there is no doubt that Europe would be well advised to seize the opportunity presented to u here by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
Madam President, I have just been talking to the group Chairman in the front row.
I have not yet had a chance to talk to the others further up, but we are entirely in favour of your making a statement expressing what I believe is the unanimous feeling of this Parliament towards the Serb people.
That is the most direct method and we hope the message can reach those people in their heroic struggle for democracy.
Thank you for that proposal, Mr Barón Crespo, and for your confidence in me.
Madam President, lady and gentlemen, I have one minute to put my position on an issue which ha been close to my heart since 1967. The evidence seems to be that the State of Israel ha no intention, and never ha had any intention, of negotiating seriously with Palestine and granting it all the power of a sovereign and independent nation.
The State of Israel see many advantage in this situation of latent conflict and doe not hesitate to make use of them.
Whatever the alleged good intention of certain Israeli leaders, nothing ha really changed for the Palestinians.
Colonisation of the occupied territory is increasing.
The economic dependence of Palestine is increasing.
Access to the Muslim Holy Places is being made more and more difficult.
The Palestinian leader are in a no-win situation.
The fact is, they either accept perpetual talks, generally under the auspex of the United States, and endorse the expansionist policy of the State of Israel or, with the aid of other Muslim country and their traditional friends, they create a new and more favourable balance of power.
This new balance of power calls, in particular, for the immediate proclamation of a Palestinian State, the use of oil a a weapon and more organised recourse to legitimate defence.
Madam President, the peace process in the Middle East is extremely fragile.
Such a situation requires tact.
Provocations such a those initiated by Mr Ariel Sharon, must be refrained from.
However, violence is not a legitimate response to provocation, and calling on the population to use violence certainly is not.
If the European Union want to be a reliable partner in the peace process, it will have to unequivocally condemn provocation and call for violent action.
To this end, my group ha tabled two amendment to the resolution to that effect.
It is not acceptable only to condemn Israel if the Palestinian leadership is still using violence a a possible tool in the negotiations.
It is heartrending if child are sacrificed in a battle which should be settled around the negotiating table.
The position of Jerusalem is a moot point in the negotiations.
I call on this Parliament to follow the Biblical line: pray for peace in Jerusalem so that the Jews and Arabs can live together in peace.
Madam President, over the last few days, we have watched the dream of peace in the Middle East disintegrate.
The horrifying picture of child running for cover being killed and of civilian being fired at from tank and helicopter give u just a tiny glimpse of the hell which could be in store for both sides, Israel and Palestine, if they fail to conclude and implement the peace process a quickly a possible.
That is the most important aspect at the moment, not apportioning blame and condemnation.
The European Union should do everything it can to serve this objective and the potential inherent in it.
However, I am not prepared - a I have been urged on several occasions, purely in order to appear fair - to refrain from calling the event of the last few day by their proper name or from making the same demand on both sides, a if the provocation and force were divided equally between them.
Or should I call on the Hamas leader Scheich Yassin to refrain from his possible intention of visiting the wailing wall on the Sabbath in order to provoke the Jews praying there?
Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army to withdraw it tank and helicopter from Israeli town and village and stop firing on civilian Israelis?
Should I perhaps call on the Palestinian army not to shoot any small Israeli child cowering behind wall and trying to take cover behind barrels?
I am not prepared to engage in this sort of fairness.
But I am prepared to call on my fellow member in the House to have the courage to call a murder a murder and to condemn provocation a provocation and not a counter-productivity, a Mrs Albright said, in order to gloss thing over, purely to appear fair towards both sides.
In this respect, I am most grateful for the clear statement made by my fellow Member Mr Lagendijk.
Madam President, I think the text of this resolution is a perfect demonstration that Europe will never act a a mediator between Israel and Palestine.
Once again, there is confusion between, on the one hand, a democratic State doing it best to deal with an extremely difficult situation and, on the other, the institution at the heart of Palestine which, under provocation certainly, immediately take up arm to shoot at the Israeli force of order.
That is happening again today, and that is what will prevent, and ha prevented Europe from acting a mediator in the Middle East all these years, leaving the United States to fulfil that role alone.
Finally, regarding Serbia, I would like to tell Mr Barón Crespo that he and his group might at least have the good grace to keep quiet on the subject, given that throughout the previous parliament his group wa willing to go to any length to block any action designed to bring Milosevic to justice, and when a majority wa achieved it wa not with the support of the Socialist Group.
Madam President, fellow Members. It is of course difficult, a event unfold in Belgrade, to sit here calmly and give a speech which wa prepared before all this came to pass.
I expected today' s event to take place last Monday.
We all know that the people have stormed Parliament, that the television station, which ha been fully occupied by the army, ha been stormed and that army vehicle and the police are now out in force in the middle of Belgrade.
We can only hope that all the people hiding behind the army and behind the police - all of whom are essentially there to serve the people, not a dictator such a Milosevic - will think twice before turning against the peaceful demonstrators.
Since democracy raised it head again in Serbia last Monday, the possibility of Serbia soon rejoining the European family is now a real possibility.
The result of the election on 24 September have made a democratic change of direction possible.
I should like to congratulate everyone who helped to achieve it: the democratic opposition and, most importantly, the people and the leader of the democratic organisation, Mr Kostunica.
I think that, in him, we have a man who understands both the Serbs and our concern and with whom we can discus a qualified procedure for bringing Serbia closer to Europe.
Since 24 September, Milosevic can no longer claim to be an elected ruler.
Everyone, including his own citizen in Serbia now clearly see that he is a dictator, who is using all the brutal, ugly and contemptuous instrument of dictatorship in his own country.
Special police units, dirty trick and deception, quasi-legal procedure which he is using in a bid to hush up the fact that the people are sick and tired of him.
He ha managed for years, with the help of his propaganda machine and by exerting brutal pressure on the media, to deceive the people in his own country and, unfortunately, many in the western world, to whom he ha misrepresented the real situation.
At last, all that is at an end.
The people in Serbia have expressed their will in democratic election and they are painfully aware of the fact that Milosevic ha no intention of respecting this will and is thinking only of hanging on to power and maintaining his contemptuous regime.
Which is why we must support Serbia in it bid for freedom.
Those who have fought for peace in south-eastern Europe for year now and who are familiar with the situation in the region, know how difficult the fight against authoritarian ruler and tyrant in most of these country wa and, in places, still is.
Sometimes we expect too much of the new people in power or we expect them to follow our view and our way of thinking, which do not fit in with their tradition and which are irreconcilable with their philosophy of life or alien to their mindset.
I should therefore like to state quite clearly that we shall soon have new contact in Serbia, who may well not understand u immediately or who will perhaps misunderstand us, partly due to inexperience and partly due to the cultural or structural difference which I have mentioned.
I should like straight away to warn against interpreting any such initial difficulty in communicating with the newly elected president a a sign of irreconcilable difference between u and the advocate of democracy in Serbia.
There are no such differences.
We can help them on the path to Europe.
If we want to give the implementation of the stability pact a real boost after the imminent change of power in Serbia and push the so-called quick start package through at long last, then we must do more than just talk.
I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to give a sign at long last and at least lift some sanctions, because these sanction have made 200 000 people in Serbia richer and richer and 10 million people poorer and poorer.
Please help u to give the people a glimmer of hope, with Kostunica, so that we can all nurse some hope for Serbia.
(Applause)
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen. We are delighted to hear that the people of Yugoslavia, mainly in Belgrade but also in other towns, have known how to take their fate into their own hand and have done so.
However, our delight is tainted with fear that there may be bloodshed, that not everyone want to and can accept the voice, power and strength of the people.
Everything must therefore be done to prevent bloodshed, because a civil war in Yugoslavia or Serbia would be a veritable disaster.
Mr Dupuis, you have abused this truly historic moment here in order to engage in political demagogy.
I have only one thing to say to you: my group and I are unequivocally in favour of bringing Milosevic to justice before the court in the Hague.
That ha always been our objective; but we have a still higher objective, which is to avoid bloodshed and we shall do everything we can so that bloodshed is avoided.
The Commission and the Council will do their part and that is what is currently at the top of the agenda in Yugoslavia and that is what we have been interested in all along.
We shall not sacrifice the Serbian people to our noble and moral objectives, because that would mean that perhaps thousand of people in Serbia and Yugoslavia might die for them.
Secondly, we are in a very delicate position and, therefore, we too trust that there will be fast change in Yugoslavia and Serbia, because the situation is not easy in either Montenegro or Kosovo.
Here, too, I have one thing to say: we have supported the effort with which the people have defended themselves against the brutal force emanating from Milosevic in both Kosovo and Montenegro, but under no circumstance do we support the concept of ethnically clean states.
Kosovo must be independent come what may and Montenegro must be independent come what may, just to ensure that Serbia is weakened.
Our objective is still - and I admit it - for there to be a new Yugoslavia, a Yugoslavia with an independent state of Kosovo and an independent state of Montenegro; it is not for there to be new divisions, renewed conflict, renewed clash or renewed force, that is not our objective; on the contrary, a new Yugoslavia need to emerge, a democratic Yugoslavia, where people stay willingly, not under duress, not under brutality, but because they are convinced that a federation can emerge which ha a democratic future, a democratic future under different leader and from which Milosevic can be removed - if possible - by bringing him before the court in the Hague, because we want justice, but we want justice with peace.
Madam President, despite his twisting and squirming we are probably seeing Milosevic's final moment in power.
It is a power that he ha abused cynically and he is now trying to cheat democracy.
We are certain that Mr Milosevic will fall, possibly this evening, certainly soon.
What we are seeing on CNN is more than the fall of Milosevic.
It is the end of the dreary succession of 20th century European tyrants.
Serbia is suffering the final pang of fascism on the fringe of our own Union.
We will all rejoice when that suffering is over.
As the drama concludes it is the duty of this Parliament, a a symbol of united free Europe, to support the crowd outside the Yugoslav parliament and to help Mr Kostunica to achieve and fulfil the mandate.
Madam President, lady and gentlemen, it is slightly bizarre that we should be discussing Serbia in this Chamber at a time when the Serbian parliament building is going up in flame and hundred of thousand of people are on the streets.
Despite this, I would like to make an attempt at explaining why I am positive and optimistic about the outcome at the moment.
There is of course the support of hundred of thousand of people - the figure of one million ha even been mooted - who are prepared at this moment to put themselves at risk in order to support the opposition and to help Mr Kostunica against the wish of Mr Milosevic.
There are also the latest report on the role of the police, which, a ha been apparent for some time, have been in doubt a to whether to continue to support the regime, and which, a it appears from the first report now coming in, have opted to side with the demonstrators; according to the latest reports, the same could happen with the army.
There is also the fact that the chairman of the state broadcasting corporation ha resigned, this being a signal, I believe, that he refuse to act a the extension and mouthpiece of the Milosevic regime any longer.
I would like to make two minor observation with regard to the future.
I wholeheartedly support the proposal and appeal by Doris Pack to reach the decision quickly, in fact a quickly a possible, to lift the sanctions, because these have done far more harm than good.
I would also like to say - and this is more of an appeal to the Council, but I am sharing it with the Commission and Parliament for now - let u not just make fine declaration with regard to the aid which we will soon be willing to grant to Serbia, but let u also make room for this cause in our own budget, the European Union' s budget, so that we do not end up concluding that we can only help Serbia by taking funding away from other project in the Balkans which need our support.
Finally, I would like to propose that a delegation from Parliament visit Serbia at the earliest opportunity, and once a new Yugoslavian government ha been installed, so that we, in tandem with this new government, can make plan for the reconstruction of a new Serbia.
Madam President, I am wondering how we can help democratic Yugoslavia, considering the way in which event appear to be, or we hope they are, unfolding now.
Our group ha confidence in our President and in the declaration which we have agreed she should make.
However, Madam President and Commissioner, we need more than pretty words.
Do not say in general terms, "Serbia belongs in Europe" , which is, after all, something which you have only recently discovered.
We refer to Yugoslavia but it is no help to Mr Kostunica if we appear to be implying that Montenegro, for example, will secede.
And to ensure we do go beyond pretty words, do you intend to propose a quickly a possible that Yugoslavia, by that I mean democratic Yugoslavia, be included in the list of candidate country for the enlargement of the European Union?
We at least hope that you do.
Madam President, Slobodan Milosevic' s latest polling box fraud come a no surprise to us. It is an electoral manoeuvre which is ad nauseam reminiscent of an extremely poor political reputation.
Precisely this unfeeling attitude is also making u fear the worst - and current event are bearing out the word written by myself only a few hour ago.
Is the Yugoslav President really making way for his opponent and probably lawfully elected successor, Vojislav Kostunica, without any bloodshed?
A pressing question indeed.
Along with the Serbian population, the Western world would be only too happy with such a switch in power in Belgrade.
However, a sense of relief should not be attended by reckless carelessness.
The European Union and the United States are being warned about this from various quarter in the region.
They consider Kostunica - in term of idea - just a much a Great-Serbian nationalist a Milosevic, with all that entail for the Montenegrins and Kosovars.
In summary, should Kostunica take Milosevic' s place, the West would do well to make aid strictly dependent on his concrete effort to establish a constitutional state in Serbia and Yugoslavia.
Madam President, I hesitated before asking to speak again because I noticed that your press secretary just handed you something and I thought perhaps you had received the latest news.
If you have not, I would be grateful if I might briefly read out the following release from the German press agency timed at 17.53 hours.
It says: several dozen member of the special police have joined with the demonstrator in Belgrade.
All the police deployed to guard the state television building stormed by the protestors, have laid down their combat weapon and have allied themselves with the demonstrators.
This wa reported on Radio Index.
Apparently at least one police station in the city centre ha joined the protestors.
That wa the latest at 17.53 hours.
Madam President, lady and gentlemen, it is clear that today may well turn out to be a historic day in this Parliament, possibly ushering in the end of one of the last buttress of a totalitarian dictatorship in Europe.
It is of course difficult to determine how long the Serbian population will need to continue fighting before Milosevic will actually disappear off the scene.
A unanimous stance on the part of the Serbian population ha proved extremely important, a it will continue to do so for the next couple of day and weeks.
This means, at the same time, that the European Union too will very much need to form a united front.
In this context, I deplore the fact that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, fortunately abandoned by almost all party in the Lower Chamber, adopted a stance out of the blue which go against the unity of the European Union and against the wish of the opposition in Serbia. I believe this display a lack of earnestness, and is at the same time insulting to his office.
It also signal an excessive drive to stand out from the rest, to the point where the life of people could be at stake.
I believe it is also important to establish at this time on what basis the High Representative and the Council will need to adopt their positions.
Will it be by largest common denominator, or on the basis of a large majority in the Council, which should not be difficult to achieve with regard to this issue?
In addition to establishing unity in the Union, this is also, of course, about recognising the fact that Kostunica ha won the presidential elections.
I wonder if the Commissioner ha planned any step in this respect to demonstrate that we really do consider Kostunica to be the only lawfully elected representative of the Serbian people, and the only partner with whom the European Union is involved a from today.
Naturally it is difficult to mention budget at this early stage.
The High Representative explained this only a moment ago, but what we can do is to selectively lift sanction by way of sending a message to the Serbian electorate.
The neighbouring country will take a great interest in this too.
I hope that the Council, in conjunction with the Commission, will take clear measure in this respect in the short term.
It is not easy to gauge Serbia' s future.
As we have already witnessed all over Central Europe, constitutional state and democracy do not blossom automatically after a revolution.
Nationalism doe not automatically disappear if a democratically elected president can be found.
We should therefore remain level-headed and focused in our attempt to create opening for a development which will bring Serbia nearer to Europe, also from a moral-political point of view.
The debate is closed.
I have received three motion for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place shortly.
Vote
Madam President, lady and gentlemen, it is a a friend of Israel that I am explaining tonight why I have voted for the joint resolution.
Indeed, while I regret a certain ambiguity in the wording and while I do not accept the failure to mention that there is a multitude of Palestinian group prepared to do anything to wipe out the State of Israel and the Israelis by mean of violence and war, it is my very friendship for the Israelis that make me implore them to end the armed repression against children.
It is also my friendship for Israel and my esteem for the Palestinians that make me implore them to do everything possible to achieve peace, even if that mean great sacrifice on both sides.
Their security and their medium- and long-term existence are at stake and no doubt world peace too, at this moment.
Mr President, if you will allow me, I would like to explain why I have abstained in the vote on the resolution regarding the Middle East.
I believe that in delicate matter such a these, preference should be given to a diplomatic stance and, a far a the specific content of Paragraph 4 is concerned, it doe not comply with the standard for a balanced resolution, in my view.
Especially with regard to the committee of inquiry, I would like to stress the fact that it should be an internationally constituted committee of enquiry and that it competence must be clearly delineated.
Mr President, there is a problem with the German urgent debate file - I do not know if the same applies to the other language version - in that it only contains the proposed amendment of the GUE group but none of the motion for resolution and not even the joint text.
That is a serious error.
If I had not been given information by Mrs Langenhagen, who is a first-class shipbuilding and shipping safety expert, I would not now know what I wa supposed to be voting on.
Please ensure that this doe not happen again.
Statement by the President on Yugoslavia
Mr President, I wish to comment on this morning' s agenda, which, a you know, is particularly lean, even though extremely important event are taking place in Europe and it is most striking that we have held an entire part-session without having a single debate on the single currency.
Last week, on 24 September, an extremely important referendum wa held, in which the Danes rejected the single currency.
Yesterday, the European Central Bank raised it intervention rate by a quarter of a point, which led to a further fall in the euro' s value.
There are two conclusion to be drawn here. Firstly, the public will never take any interest in our debate if Parliament persists in side-stepping discussion on every important issue.
Secondly, the euro is an artificial currency and it would be a disaster to make a complete changeover to the euro in the present circumstances.
Mr President, I just wanted to draw attention to the huge pile of document we needed for voting this week.
I would like to congratulate the honourable Members.
We have all been very industrious.
(Laughter, applause)
Thank you, Mr Rübig.
Loans for project in Croatia
The next item is the report (A5-0237/2000) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so a to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loan for project in Croatia (COM(2000) 289 - C5-0336/2000 - 2000/0122(CNS)).
Mr President, the European Investment Bank grant loan to non-EU countries, guaranteed by the European Union. The bank guarantee individual loan freely in accordance with it own criterion and not the precise guideline laid down by the EU.
However, the Union ha fixed a ceiling for the loan it guarantees.
The loan are not guaranteed one hundred percent and the Council decided in December 1999 to guarantee just 65% of the final total for loan for the period 2000-2007.
For the rest the bank must itself obtain other form of security or cover the risk itself.
In practice there is no risk and the European Investment Bank would even be prepared to lower the percentage the EU guarantees.
There is a special Guarantee Fund in the Union budget for loan from the EIB.
For each guarantee, fund are transferred from a special reserve into the Guarantee Fund, with a maximum amount decided in the finance framework contained in the interinstitutional agreement.
In 2000 a maximum of 204 million euro can be transferred from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund.
Technically 9% of the sum for EIB loan should be transferred from the reserve into the Guarantee Fund, a figure representing 65% of the nominal value of the loans.
The Guarantee Fund in the budget is also used for macroeconomic aid to non-EU countries.
It is a cheap way for the Member States to grant development aid.
These loan are granted on political ground to the EU' s humble partner and they are guaranteed one hundred percent by the Guarantee Fund, unlike the Investment Bank loans.
In macroeconomic aid it is often a question of the EU' s share in an overall package in which other source of aid are the World Bank and the IMF.
Generally, financial aid to non-member country is granted in accordance with the economic and political behavioural criterion set by the IMF - the more guarantee are given for Investment Bank loans, the le macroeconomic aid can be granted, and vice versa.
The Guarantee Fund can also be used to guarantee the Euratom loan to support the development of core industry in non-member countries, although no transfer from the reserve to the Guarantee Fund have had to be organised for these sort of loan in recent years.
In December 1999 the Council decided the maximum amount for guarantee for the Investment Bank for the period 2000-2007, and produced a list of non-member country that would be entitled to receive aid.
The European Parliament adopted a position on the matter in a report by Mrs Rühle in autumn 1999.
As Parliament ha been heard, the matter is no longer being discussed in Parliament with regard to the term and condition of the guarantees.
Parliament must today decide a very simple matter: whether Croatia should join that group of country to which the European Investment Bank may grant loan with an EU guarantee.
Croatia is no longer at war and democratic change ha taken place there.
So there are good ground for the country joining the group of borrowers, just a there are to increase the ceiling of the EIB mandate.
If Parliament could table amendment to the Council Decision it would certainly remind u of Croatia' s unemployment and social problems, which are the result of that country being put on a slimming regimen, but there is no legal basis here for such amendments.
The same problem of legal competence will also apply in the decision to be discussed soon in Parliament regarding Turkey joining the group of those country receiving loan guarantee given by the EU to the European Investment Bank.
Parliament is bound to have a lot of condition it would like to impose on loan to Turkey, but at the time we will be making a decision in practice with regard to just one word.
Today we add Croatia to the list of those receiving guarantee and then it will be Turkey' s turn.
In this connection we will at the same time make it known to the Commission that next year the Guarantee Fund reserve will not be sufficient for guaranteeing the loan we can expect.
Mr President, this proposal for a Council decision with a view to extending, for the first time, the Community guarantee for the European Investment Bank undoubtedly ha a truly extraordinary scope.
Before commenting specifically on the issue raised by this proposal for a decision, I should like to express our support for it, since it endorses Parliament' s position on relation between the European Union and Croatia.
For this very reason, I wish to state from the outset that I share the concern expressed by the rapporteur a few minute ago on the situation of the loan guarantee reserve, whose narrow margin could cause problem should any unforeseen event occur.
There is one decision that must be put in a dual context. We should consider Croatia' s situation firstly from a strictly political point of view.
We must welcome the new political direction that is being taken there, following the legislative and presidential elections.
The European Union must encourage Croatia to remain firmly grounded in democracy and the rule of law and there is no doubt that this encouragement must be translated into action involving financial support to improve the economic situation there and to enable the Croatian people to make the necessary sacrifice to balance out the fundamental deficit in their public accounts.
The EIB can and must play a leading role in the region, but this powerful financial instrument serving the external policy of the Union, whose activities, in accordance with the mandate provided by the 1999 decision, cover more than sixty countries, must match it action to those of the Commission. It must also be made clear that the Commission cannot distance itself from the recent agreement that wa reached in the tripartite dialogue in July, when a commitment wa given to the effect that every new proposal' s compatibility with existing financial programming must be substantiated in the financial statement.
From the operational point of view, I believe that both the loan guarantee reserve that ha been provided for in the current financial perspective, and the functioning of the Guarantee Fund require an improvement in the mechanism for achieving the objective of quality and efficiency in Union loan that are given budgetary guarantees.
In this sense, the rapporteur' s analysis strike me a being an admirable starting point.
It doe not seek to cast doubt on the budgetary protection plan nor on the role of the EIB.
The Interinstitutional Agreement provides for a series of three-part dialogue to take place within the budgetary procedure.
Given this context and bearing in mind the narrow margin of the loan guarantee reserve, which is set at EUR 200 million per year, there is no reason why we should not discus the priority us of this margin in coming years.
Our aim is clearly to improve the efficiency of the European Investment Bank. In order to achieve this, the Commission must ensure that the most thorough assessment possible of it activity will be carried out.
We cannot content ourselves with saying that we have a reliable system of guarantees.
In the budgetary procedure for 2001, our political group ha maintained a strategy of pursuing a marked improvement in the quality of expenditure and an improvement in the mechanism for monitoring it performance.
It is time to call for the same objective with regard to the activity of the EIB.
What is clear is that Parliament cannot restrict it role to passively assimilating the information supplied to it by the Commission and the EIB, or to giving it blessing to the decision of the Council.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, the report by the Committee on Budgets under discussion, which recommends extending the Community guarantee given to the European Investment Bank to loan granted to Croatia, deal with two important matters.
Firstly, the political situation in Croatia ha improved dramatically.
The new government is committed to political and economic reform.
That is an opportunity for the European Union to continue once more with cooperation, which wa interrupted in 1995 when Croatia began military action in Krajina.
The other message is contained in Croatia' s still very difficult economic situation.
For year the country practised an economic policy based on plundering, which ha left the new government to shoulder the burden of a depressed business sector and an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
The rapporteur, Esko Seppänen, say quite rightly in the explanatory statement in his report that social condition in Croatia are difficult and the Community' s contribution to the reform process should also have a positive impact on the social dimension.
An important political change wa seen in Croatia in the parliamentary election that were held earlier this year.
The country' s inhabitant showed by voting that they demanded democratic change.
The new government wa made up of a democratic frontline of six parties, which ha a firm majority in the country' s parliament.
The government ha indicated it is rapidly recognising the value of European democracy and the rule of law.
In foreign relation it give priority to the integration of a Euro-Atlantic framework.
In it programme, the government is committed to such matter a a respect for human right and the right of minorities, the repatriation of refugees, improved relation with it neighbours, and considerable economic reform.
Legislation is already in place to achieve these aims.
Developments in Croatia have swiftly led to closer relation between the EU and Croatia after a gap of several years.
Between the Union and Croatia there is an advisory working party in place, whose purpose it is to offer Croatia expertise and technical assistance in negotiation on contractual relations.
According to the Commission, talk on the Stability and Association Pact with the country should be started a soon a possible.
The Council decided in August that the Tempus 3 programme, which relates to higher education, should extend to Croatia.
In July the Commission freed 10 million euro to support the repatriation of refugees.
The proposal under discussion contains a target figure of 250 million euro in EIB loan for Croatia for the period 2000-2007.
With that sum, it is proposed to finance basic infrastructure project and environmental investment, the development of industry and SMEs, housing reconstruction, urban renewal and tourism.
The plan are in accordance with project that were put forward by Croatia at the Regional Funding Conference held in March.
Croatia' s leader are committed to difficult but necessary economic reform.
The cure will be hard to endure, but, hopefully, the loan now being spoken about will help to soften the negative effect of economic reform on the life of the people.
We also have to remember that Croatia ha good industrial manufacturing plants, a qualified and trained workforce and excellent opportunity for the development of tourism, for example.
According to a survey by the Commission the country' s competitiveness in European market could be strengthened enormously with a raft of consistently applied and ambitious structural reforms, but at present many Croatian business still have problem competing in the free economy.
The event in the Balkans and the future of the region are burning issues.
This week, in the wake of the Presidential elections, we have followed the situation in Yugoslavia with bated breath.
The wind of change are blowing in Belgrade too.
The international community ha already indicated it will support the Serbian nation and sanction are being lifted.
The European Union and the European Parliament have every reason to support positive development in the Balkans.
Instability in the region is a threat to Europe a a whole.
We know that nationalism and poverty mean war.
Ahead of u there is a massive amount of physical and spiritual reconstruction to take place and we also, for our part, have to clear the barrier to effective assistance.
Unfortunately, interinstitutional discussion on next year' s budget - in particular section IV on financing - still appear to be very difficult for the time being.
Hopefully, the sign of hope in Croatia and now also in Yugoslavia will encourage u to find a solution to the problem of the budget and it financial perspectives.
Mr President, last night we discussed the topic of Serbia and the revolutionary change that are taking place there.
In somewhat le dramatic style, Croatia changed government last year.
In any event, the election victory of the opposition wa given the same recognition.
This is why it is possible to pick up where we left off in 1995.
The chance of achieving a stabilisation and association agreement have now been looked into, and it is expected that negotiation on this topic will begin before the end of this year.
A delegation of the European Union ha been primed for action, and a you know, the Summit at the end of November will take place precisely in Zagreb, in order to give Croatia the message that the country is welcome in European Union circles.
This is why it is necessary for the economy to be rebuilt.
In it recent past, Croatia ha witnessed dramatic change for the worse and widespread corruption.
Let u not forget that, until recently, Croatia wa the classic example of a privatisation programme which had got completely out of hand, and which benefited only one individual.
This whole process will need bolstering, which will require enormous investment - investment in infrastructure, in the environment, but also investment in very risky operations.
As we all know, setting up small and medium-sized business in that kind of country is risky.
Things can go wrong, and this also applies to the reception of refugees, an investment goal which wa lacking from the rapporteur' s report, unfortunately.
These too are risky investments.
It is therefore only justified that the mandate of the European Investment Bank will be increased by 250 million.
The European Union is acting a guarantor.
But this is exactly where the problem lies, because we are now at the same point where we were last night when we were discussing the subject of Serbia, namely the fact that the Council underestimated the actual cost to be incurred in the Balkans last year in Berlin.
As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I know that the member of the Committee on Budgets have criticised me and my colleague for continually wanting more fund for the Balkans, and for having to enter into negotiation with the Council, which is not always that easy.
But there is very definitely a real problem.
I mentioned it yesterday when we were debating Serbia and I am repeating it here.
It is not acceptable that the rift between the pledge and promise made by the European Union on the one hand, and the reserved funding on the other hand, should be a huge a it is now threatening to become.
Having spoken fine word yesterday and having granted this guarantee today, the European Union cannot afford to arrive in Belgrade empty-handed tomorrow.
I would therefore urge the fellow Members but also, and mainly, the Council, to stick a closely a possible to the Commission' s proposal during the next couple of month of negotiation on the budget for next year and subsequent years, the reason being that, in my view, the proposal still provides the best estimate of the total cost in Croatia, but also in other part of the Balkans.
I would now like to turn my attention to the overall programme for the Balkans.
I support the amendment by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which is right in saying that this loan is important, but that, in the final analysis, the overall programme, given the necessary financial backing, is more important.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and explanatory comments.
I am sure we are all agreed that Croatia must be given political assistance, but political assistance also entail financial support, because political stability is always a prerequisite to social and economic stability. This can only be achieved, of course, if there is an appropriate level of investment in this sphere.
There is not a moment to lose if the fall in GDP recorded for 1999 and the increase in the budgetary deficit in Croatia are to be halted and reversed. In the final analysis, the only way to achieve this is through Croatia developing self-supporting economic cycles.
The contribution under discussion, which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007, may not prove to be a milestone, but it would certainly help the process on it way.
The course of action proposed by the Commission and backed by the report is the inevitable outcome.
However, the problem that have come to light and which are a yet unresolved, are something else altogether.
It is generally the case that new political challenge demand increased financial outlay, but not - I might add - at the expense of others.
Therefore, we must think in general term - and hopefully arrive at positive political decision - firstly, about increasing the reserve for the guarantee fund, and secondly, about the fact that it must not be left solely to the Council to determine how the residual margin is to be used, and thirdly, about establishing binding criterion for the effective deployment of the EIB loan, so a to be able, at the end of the day, to monitor whether this package is actually consistent with the necessary objective for which it wa intended.
Mr President, living through these dramatic hours, we look to Belgrade and hope that a process of democratisation will get underway there which will present u with a real democracy in the course of the next few years.
Yet there is still a huge question mark hanging over all this.
We want to support and welcome the process, but we must not get carried away.
Croatia started building a democracy a long a ten year ago.
Democratic election were held there in 1990, which the international community deemed fair and free.
Following these election the former Communist government, under the leadership of the present Prime Minister, Mr Racan, stepped down in a disciplined manner and a new democratic development began under the Tudjman government. According to the international community though, a few crack started to develop in this administration, and the situation went downhill from there.
We must now consider the bigger picture.
Looking back, not only did this country have to rid itself of the burdensome legacy of fifty year of Communist government - and all Central and Eastern European States, including the candidate state still have their work cut out there - a third of this country wa occupied by foreign troop under the Dictator Milosevic, who held office at the time and is still in office today.
A third of Croatia wa occupied, and it wa many year before the country wa reunited and a democracy established which - and this is a point worth emphasising - led to a peaceful change of government.
The current administration did not take over under the condition faced by, what will hopefully be the future government in Belgrade, because the previous government in Croatia stepped down after free and fair elections, and then a new government took office.
It is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in term of democratisation.
Democratisation took place in Croatia ten year ago.
We must also recognise what remarkable achievement there have been over the past ten year in term of building a market economy, democracy and a constitutional state.
Mr Langendijk is right, some colossal mistake were made with privatisation.
There wa corruption on a massive scale, but if you take a look round the associated countries, the candidate states, you will detect the same trend there.
The current democratic government in Croatia and it democratic opposition, need our full support.
I therefore welcome the fact that we are going to take the decision today to adopt the guarantee payments.
But we must be clear in our own mind that this is only a first step in the right direction.
Mr Markov wa right to point out that fund are scarce, and that this can only be a first step.
Our aim must be to forge ahead down this path, not just by providing more funds, but, above all, by sending out political signals.
To this end, we must at last conclude an Association Agreement with Croatia, which will spell out that this is a European country that ha a definite future a a member of the European Union.
I therefore say 'yes' to financial aid, and 'yes' to this guarantee, but, at the same time, would call upon the Commission most emphatically to lend massive support to this deeply European, and now truly democratic and constitutionally governed country, and to include it in the list of candidate countries, because I believe Croatia ha earned our full support.
This could send out a signal to the entire region and might lead to it rejuvenation.
Mr President, these days, we cannot talk about Croatia without seeing it in the context of it neighbour Serbia, where the people are now finally throwing off the yoke of the authoritarian government clique. A clique which referred to itself a socialist, but managed to stay in power for more than ten year by using fascist method alone.
Along with legal inequality for the opposition and overt state violence, this also manifested itself in the fact that fear wa instilled in the people of Serbia vis-à-vis the big bad world outside and that people who criticised the regime were proclaimed traitor to their own country.
The same formula ha been applied in Croatia over the past ten years. Croatia is not one of the state we have been discussing this week a being potential future candidate state of the Union.
In many respects, the position of that country is the same a that of Slovakia, which is now a candidate state.
Up until 1918, both region were rebellious section of Hungary and boasted their own language, culture and identity, but were thwarted by the official state authority.
International pressure forced them thereafter not to become fully independent, but to join new large collective state which were intended a melting pot for minor Slavonic peoples, but they never managed to integrate properly.
When half a century ago, Croatia and Slovakia became nominally independent for the first time, they became vassal of the Hitler regime.
In 1945, the outside world agreed that these state should cease to exist permanently.
With the benefit of hindsight, this wa a silly move.
Ignoring the wish of those people to be able to make independent decisions, provided the breeding ground for aggressive and authoritarian nationalism for years, a nationalism which had little consideration for the tragic legacy left by the Nazi era and which wa hostile towards other people and democracy at home.
People hid behind Tudjman and Meciar because they saw this a the only guarantee for being treated a equal vis-à-vis their neighbour who used to rule over them.
It is only now that all their reasonable demand have been met and nobody doubt the right to independence any longer, that nationalism is fading away and normal political alliance are emerging.
The nationalist recently lost political power in both countries.
This could serve a a lesson for other strongly nationalist regions.
The only way to eradicate nationalism is to meet all reasonable demand of those nationalists.
There is now every reason for treating Croatia in the same way a Slovakia and other Central European country which can join the European Union if they so wish.
The damage done by the war ha not yet been cleared, a we witnessed recently.
The country' s road infrastructure is vulnerable because Dalmatia and Slavonia form the two half of a pair of scissors, a it were, with Bosnia being wedged in the middle, which, particularly in West Herzegovina, is also populated by Croats.
The environment in the large population concentration in Zagreb, Rijeka and Osijek is at risk.
This set of circumstance will probably necessitate huge investments, which will not be repaid until later on in the form of tourism and new industry.
This is why it would be useful to make the necessary arrangement at this stage.
Along with the rapporteur, I do wonder whether the fund will be made available in real terms, especially now it appears that Serbia will also be needing large fund shortly and the Union' s budget is not being increased.
There is little point in the European Union making pledge to crisis area and candidate state left, right and centre, which it cannot meet.
As far a Croatia is concerned, there is every reason to set up a financial arrangement.
The comment which my colleague Mr Papayannakis made yesterday about admitting Serbia to the European Union should also apply to Croatia.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, the last few interventions, yesterday' s debate and the one we are having today, show that despite the necessary and widely approved increase in the guarantee payment, and the increase in the guarantee payment for the EIB loan, a we see it, what is needed is an overall plan for this region, a contractual agreement that cut across the political divide and incorporates aspect of economic policy, together with discussion and decision-making.
There is another individual measure that ha been well received today.
Of course we cannot consider the issue of guarantee payment and the issue of Croatia separately from the debate that took place yesterday evening and the development in Belgrade.
We must immediately appeal to the military and the police, in no uncertain terms, to throw their full weight behind democracy, and do all they can to ensure that this changeover of power - which wa triggered by the outcome of democratic election - proceeds peacefully over the next few hours.
We have every intention of recognising these democratic election and the electoral victory of Vojislav Kostunica.
Of course my country, Austria, in common with all the other European countries, will also have to do it bit towards the reconstruction of Yugoslavia, in tandem with the European Union.
We will also do everything in our power to ensure that the anticipated removal of sanction against former Yugoslavia is implemented in full.
Our honourable friend, Mr Posselt, wa correct in what he said about the development in Croatia.
But we are all agreed, nonetheless, that the parliamentary and presidential election that took place in January 2000 have produced a new political climate.
The new government ha reinforced it commitment to political and economic reform.
This will have a positive effect on relation between Croatia and the EU.
The European Union' s response to this development ha been not only to appoint the advisory EU-Croatia Task Force, but also to develop the office of the special representative in Zagreb into a permanent representative office of the European Commission.
In the feasibility report on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia, compiled in May 2000, the Commission reach the conclusion that the condition for taking up negotiation with Croatia have been fulfilled.
The delegation from the Croatian Parliament and from our own, have also called upon the Council to extend the EIB mandate.
The Council held in June established that all the precondition to commencing negotiation on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement had been meet.
In July, the European Commission forwarded the draft of a negotiating mandate to the Member States, for them to comment on.
Austria, the country I come from, wa one of the first three Member States, to make a positive statement.
The reason I mention this development in the year 2000, after the election, is because it show that we need to do more than increase the guarantee fund.
We have already come a long way.
We must single-mindedly pursue the process that started in May and July a far a an Association Agreement.
Croatia and the region deserve this in the interest of peace within Europe.
Mr President, first of all I must declare a personal interest, I have a son-in-law who was, and is, a refugee from the Krajina in Croatia.
Even if it is now technically possible to return, much more ha to be done to make the return of Serbs to Croatia and the Krajina in particular positively welcome.
Much physical restoration is required in that sad part of Croatia.
We in the European Union must insist that this is positively encouraged and not just a nominal gesture.
Our financial contribution should be on that condition and I would appreciate a reassurance from the Commission that this aspect will be taken into account.
My second point refers to Serbia itself.
Even if there is the happy, democratic outcome, which we hope for in Serbia, there will still be great resentment resulting from what happened with the Kosovo campaign and our recent relationship with Serbia.
This will not be overcome immediately.
We in Europe must be prepared to rise above any peevish reaction to those sentiments.
The top priority, not just for Serbia but for all the Balkans including Bulgaria and Romania, is to restore normal transport link in the whole area and bring Serbia with all it hurt back into the European fold.
I am grateful, on behalf of the Commission, to Mr Seppänen for his report relating to the proposal to extend the existing Community guarantee for European Investment Bank lending outside the Union to cover intervention in Croatia.
As the House will know and a ha been remarked again this morning, the parliamentary and presidential election early this year resulted in the change of government in Croatia and brought a new political climate.
We celebrate that and we act a a Community to support it.
But I cannot let this debate pas without referring to another part of former Yugoslavia which is beginning the century with hope and the prospect of freedom.
I am speaking of the glorious revolution taking place now in Serbia, thanks to the courage of the Serbian people and their insistence on democracy.
The House will know that the Commission ha made it crystal clear that European Union sanction will stop with the advent of democratic government in Serbia.
When it appears that Milosevic ha fled and the will of the people ha prevailed, we hope that action to establish normal relation and partnership between Serbia and this Union of democracy will only be day away.
Meanwhile the new government in Croatia is clearly demonstrating it serious commitment to putting that country on a secure democratic path and to implementing the political and economic reform necessary to adhere to the condition of the European Union stabilisation and association process for the western Balkans.
Taking account of those advance last May, the Commission produced a positive feasibility report on the opening of negotiation for a stabilisation and association agreement with Croatia and on 19 July recommended opening negotiations.
This constitutes a major step forward in EU-Croatia bilateral relations.
The Commission hope that a decision can be taken in November so that negotiation can start without too much delay.
It is also essential for the Community to provide appropriate financial support for Croatia.
The resumption of EIB lending is intended to assist the country's investment activity in infrastructure and private sector development.
The new Croatian leadership clearly need dependable and sustained backing to pursue demanding reforms.
The proposal before the House would cover up to EUR 250 million of lending over the next four years.
As Mr Purvis ha just said - and I fully acknowledge - that must be regarded a part of a process of normalisation, stabilisation and progress that extends over many years.
The rapporteur ha not proposed any amendments.
I therefore thank him and the House for supporting this useful and progressive proposal a an investment in stable democracy in yet another part of our continent.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Explanations of vote
Mr President, I wanted to be here not just to state that I voted for this aid for Croatia but, above all, to have the chance to express my satisfaction, a others have today, at the democratic event taking place in Serbia at the moment.
After many year of difficulty for this people - all kind of difficulty - we are at last, extremely democratically, beginning to welcome Serbia back into the community of the people of the European Union.
I hope that negotiation will soon get underway and, a with Croatia, that aid will also be granted to the Serbian people, who deserve our greatest respect.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting wa closed at 9.45 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 6 October 2000.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, the Minutes of the Parliamentary sitting tell u that the issue wa raised in this Chamber of the racist attack made on a teacher in Verona.
The Minutes also say that Parliament condemned the incident and, in particular, expressed it solidarity with the teacher.
I would like to inform you that the teacher in question invented the whole story and ha confessed that he wa not the victim of an attack at all but that his wound were self-inflicted.
What this amount to is that we have all been taken for a ride.
I just wanted to inform you of this, seeing that this hoodwinking of Parliament by the teacher from Verona is recorded in the Minutes.
Mr Speroni, this information doe not, most probably, require any amendment to the Minutes, but I take note of your comment nonetheless.
Are there any further comment on the Minutes?
(The Minutes were approved)
Statements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, a you know, since our last part-session, a fortnight ago, three more people have been shot and killed by ETA.
Let me mention their name and, in commemorating them, express our compassion and sympathy at this time of sadness to the member of their families: Luis Portero, Chief Public Prosecutor of the Regional Court of Andalucia, murdered in Granada on 9 October;
Antonio Munos Carignanos, a colonel and doctor in the Spanish air force, murdered in Seville on 16 October;
Maximo Casado, a prison service employee, murdered yesterday morning in Vitoria.
It is on behalf of the whole House that I express our most sincere condolence and deepest sympathy to the family and friend of these people.
These victim take the number of ETA murder victim since the cease-fire wa broken on 3 December 1999 to a total of sixteen.
Even if we cannot find the word to express our response to such a tragedy, we must not give up the fight by any means.
Quite the opposite.
As we have always done on each of these sad occasions, we must, once again, condemn this intolerable behaviour.
The right to life is sacrosanct.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which wa approved in Biarritz by unanimous decision of the Heads of State and Government, reaffirms this most categorically.
I would ask you, lady and gentlemen, to pay tribute to these victim by observing a minute' s silence, and to lend our support to the authority and to democrat in Spain in their fight against this scourge, a fight that often put their life in jeopardy.
Thank you for observing a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
o
o o
President.
Unfortunately, I must again take the floor to pay tribute to the memory of all those who have been victim of the upsurge of hatred and xenophobia in the Middle East.
Tomorrow, this House will discus this sensitive issue a part of it debate on the Biarritz European Council, but today I should just like to express my deep sadness at a phenomenon that we find disturbing in the extreme, since it is a tragic illustration of the baleful influence of the extremist on both sides.
On behalf of all the Members of this House, I would express our deepest sympathy to all the member of the family of the victim of this conflict, and further express my solidarity with all the people wounded in the conflicts.
I hope, moreover, that the advocate of peace and dialogue will ultimately succeed in prevailing over those that incite to violence and hatred.
o
o o
President.
Finally, a you know, several day ago, torrential rain caused unprecedented damage in Switzerland and Italy, resulting in the death of twenty-five people, injuring many more, and occasioning extensive material damage.
The day before yesterday, in Spain, heavy rain and flooding wa also to blame for the death of three people, with three others reported missing.
I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to express our distress at these event and to offer the family of the victim our deepest sympathy. If you agree, I shall once again ask you to observe a minute' s silence in honour of these victims.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Mr Trakatellis, I shall give you the floor on a procedural motion, but let me first point out for your benefit, and for the benefit of all Members of the House, that on the Tuesday of the last part-session, I explained in our plenary sitting that, after receiving strong protest from a great many Members who considered that, on the previous day, the right to speak on procedural motion had been abused ...
... I explained, then, that speaker on procedural motion would be cut off after one minute, a expressly stipulated in the Rules of Procedure, in Rule 141, to be precise.
I should just like to point that out.
Your applause today, a well a the applause I heard on the Tuesday of the last part-session, confirms that you endorse this approach.
Madam President, it is quite right that the municipal election in Himara were marked by violence and fraud at the expense of the Greek minority living there.
That this happened is beyond question.
We have the finding of international organisation which monitored the elections.
Albania is a country whose own minority have suffered persecution at the hand of other country and, a we all know, the international community reacted to this persecution.
It should not repeat inside it border what it suffered outside it borders; that is, I think, the first lesson in democracy which we should bring to the attention of this country, which is starting to establish an internal democracy.
I should like the European Parliament to take note of these violation and, of course, to call for repeat election in Himara.
Madam President, in connection with your word on the Middle East, I would like to announce an initiative conceived by some of the female Members of Parliament - Nuala Ahern, Pasqualina Napoletano, Ana Palacio Vallelersundi, Ulla Sandbaek and myself - who have asked other woman to go with u to Jerusalem to meet with Palestinian and Israeli woman who, in recent years, have never stopped trying to communicate with one other and build bridge of peace. And so, in this spirit, we invite the woman of the European Parliament to be part of this delegation.
We will make an appeal on Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the name and signature of those woman who wish to be part of the delegation. Our intention is to build bridge of peace between woman in place where violence prevails.
Madam President, I would just like to inform the two Greek speaker that the next meeting of the South-Eastern Europe delegation - in the course of which we will also receive representative from Albania - will also address this issue, and I am certain that with Mrs Pack in the chair, we will approach the matter objectively.
Madam President, last week, the MEP Karla Peijs wa attacked in Brussels.
I would urge you to approach the Belgian Government again and to see to it that security level are stepped up in Brussels.
Indeed, Mr Rübig, I shall do so.
Madam President, I have a question concerning the Statute for Members.
My question is: Who is speaking for the European Parliament concerning this Statute?
I ask because when I read the public statement made by our colleague, Mr Rothley, I get the impression that we have appointed a saboteur and not a rapporteur.
I hope that you are speaking for Parliament rather than Mr Rothley.
Madam President, I understand that you will shortly be announcing the decision of the French Government to terminate my mandate a a Member of the European Parliament.
I believe that this is a grave injustice and a penalty which is out of all proportion to the minor incident which served a a pretext for it.
I received no notice in order to prepare my defence.
I wa not permitted to waive my parliamentary immunity and I did not have the benefit of any of the defence that even a guilty party would have.
I believe that the European Parliament ha the opportunity in this case to, perhaps, demonstrate it ability to come to the defence of it own dignity.
Madam President, there are more victim of ETA, but there are also more victim of the Spanish repression: more arrests, more people tortured, new dispersal of political prisoner jailed in the Basque country.
All in all there ha been more suffering for Basques and Spaniards; certainly the Spaniards and Basques are fed up with the present conflict.
It is not surprising if they express their profound dismay more and more clearly because, with the exception of the Spanish Government, no one belief in the benefit of the ongoing strategy.
Can the European Parliament give up hope of ever finding a democratic . . .
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, I do not wish to be repetitive, but the situation requires it.
You are aware of the situation in Campo de Gibraltar, where there is a damaged British nuclear submarine.
As we have feared and supposed since the start, according to the technicians, the significance of the damage is increasing daily with the passage of time.
I ask you, Madam President, to do everything possible to speed up the procedure under way in the Committee on Petitions concerning a protest document that ha been presented by more than thirty social group and NGOs against this situation, in which there ha been a blatant failure to comply with Community regulation on radiation protection.
Madam President, firstly, I would like to speak a chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to point out, following on from what Mr Haarder said, that Mr Rothley, first Vice-Chairman of the Committee, is not a spokesman but a rapporteur, and I think that so far he ha conducted himself impeccably within that mandate.
Secondly, I would like to speak in support of Mrs Morgantini' s motion.
I think we are at a stage in the process in the Middle East in which dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli female Members of Parliament and European female Members of Parliament could contribute to resolving this conflict.
Madam President, if I have understood correctly, we are at present establishing our Agenda.
Our Rules of Procedure do not admit any point of order at this juncture.
According to the Rules of Procedure, we are allowed procedural motion pursuant to Rule 141 and point of order with reference to the Rules of Procedure pursuant to Rule 142, but not, in any manner of speaking, point of order, especially not to make the kind of representation we have just heard.
Apparently, just anyone can stand up and say whatever they want when the Agenda come up.
When oh when, Madam President, are you going to apply the Rules of Procedure and nothing but the Rules of Procedure?
Let me answer you, Mr Goebbels.
This is a problem that everyone chairing a sitting ha to deal with.
The problem is determining whether a matter is ground for a procedural motion or not.
I feel that if we stop to discus whether, every time a Member wish to speak on a procedural motion, it actually complies with the Rules of Procedure or not, then we shall waste a great deal of time.
I think applying the minute rule is the least damaging solution, in the final analysis, a we have, in fact, seen.
Madam President, you will recall that at the last part-session I raised the plight of the British democracy campaigner, James Mawdsley, who wa held illegally by the Burmese authorities.
You promised to convey your concern, and subsequently this House passed a resolution condemning his imprisonment.
That wa part of a concerted diplomatic effort and the House will be pleased to have learned that Mr Mawdsley wa released by the Burmese authority last week.
I should like to take this opportunity to thank you and Members of this House for the part you played in seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
I hope that we can return before too long to the question of the thousand of other people who are political prisoner in Burma and the lack of democracy which afflicts that country.
Madam President, when my fellow Danish MEP, Mr Bertel Haarder, spoke a little while ago, his Danish wa so garbled that it wa completely impossible to understand what he wa saying.
Could you not make sure that we can hear what he is saying in future?
It wa really difficult to understand his Danish.
Madam President, last Monday, Antonio Russo, the Radio Radicale correspondent, wa found dead in Georgia with his chest caved in. He wa the only Western journalist to remain in Pristina, in Kosovo, for a number of week last year.
The autopsy performed in Georgia revealed that he wa the victim of murder and had, in all probability, been tortured.
Antonio Russo, a courageous journalist, wa investigating the crime taking place in Chechnya, and it is our opinion that this wa the reason for his tragic death.
I know that it would not be usual for Parliament to hold another minute's silence - and I would not be so bold a to propose this - but I wanted you to be informed of the development, for Antonio Russo wa a journalist and a very brave man who gave his life for the freedom of information for all people.
Madam President, pursuant to the second paragraph of Rule 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure, the President is bound to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market before ratifying the decision of the French Government.
The Council of State ruling, which you will perhaps be invoking a a defence very shortly, wa issued by a body which ha no jurisdiction in the matter, whereas French law stipulates that only plenary is competent to rule on the subject of the mandate of a Member of the European Parliament.
In the course of this procedure, Madam President, the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Jean-Marie Le Pen, ha been violated from start to finish.
I do not see how you can cite the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a you did a short time ago, without actually implementing it in the exercise of your office.
Madam President, lady and gentlemen, the topic of violence is given priority status in this Parliament and that is how it should continue to be.
Further to your appeal and your expression of sympathy with the family of the victim of violence, we too would like to show our solidarity with all those who are protesting today against the violence of ETA in so many place in the Basque country.
That is why, after approval of this agenda, we intend to hold a small, peaceful demonstration, which will take a few minutes, in front of the Parliament building, together with all colleague and delegate in this House who wish to attend.
Madam President, it is not possible to let Mr Gollnisch impugn the supreme administrative court in France without responding. If he respected the rule of law, he would respect it jurisdiction.
As for Mr Le Pen, what an affront to the dignity of the European Parliament and for any true democrat to hear Mr Le Pen using the word 'dignity' !
Madam President, I have a genuine point of order.
We have no urgent procedure this week, yet, Chechnya, Albania, Burma and Palestine have already been discussed.
My question to you is this: can we not change the Rules of Procedure in such a way that we no longer have urgent procedures, but deal with these matter at the beginning of the sitting instead?
(Applause)
Do you see, Mr Goebbels? Is this actually a procedural motion or not?
Believe me, we could spend hour and hour debating the point.
Madam President, between 3 October 2000 and yesterday, at least seven memorial were desecrated, eight people were subjected to racist attacks, four hostel for asylum seeker were set upon, and seven synagogues, Jewish cemetery or memorial were desecrated in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Just because, Madam President, lady and gentlemen, we are supposed to be discussing the order of business doe not mean that we have to take order a to our business.
A number of Members of Parliament have had a fantastic dream, this I can understand.
They have dreamt of building the kind of federal state envisaged by Chairman Spinelli, for instance, or turning our Treaties into a constitution.
Well, today, acknowledging that the jurisdiction of the European Parliament is subject to a State, regardless of which one this is, and ha a bounden duty to terminate the mandate of one of our fellow Members, would be to admit that Parliament is not a sovereign assembly and must yield to national legal or government authorities.
Madam President, lady and gentlemen, we have the opportunity to take a great step towards your dream, one I do not, however, personally share.
Simply by acknowledging that the European Parliament ha the discretionary power to settle the matter of the termination of the mandate, you will have gone some way towards achieving your federal dream. Otherwise, Madam President, in yielding to the authority of others, you are effectively taking a step backwards.
Madam President, I am astounded, all the same, that the case of the termination of Mr Le Pen' s mandate ha not been dealt with, or even mentioned, by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, considering that this is the first time under either the Third, Fourth or Fifth Republic that we have had a French Member of Parliament thrown out of office for a matter of a minor offence.
A whole series of violation of the law - not just French law, but also European law - have taken place and I feel it would be a grave mistake not to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market or to hear Mr Le Pen' s side of the case.
Agenda
The final version of the draft agenda a drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at it meeting of 19 October 2000 ha been distributed.
Relating to Monday: I have received a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to defer Mrs Klass' s report, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, to a later part-session.
Mr Lannoye wish to speak a the author of this request.
Madam President, Mrs Klass' s report ha already been deferred twice.
We would, however, like to request that it be deferred for a third time for political reasons.
The fact is, this apparently technical report, which doe not seem to make any great change of a political nature, is extremely important insofar a it introduces the possibility of carrying out genetic engineering in viticulture and hence ending up with genetically modified viticulture.
We think, given that for the moment we are at the conciliation stage with regard to the framework directive on GMOs, that it would be wiser to await the conclusion of these conciliation proceeding and to deal with this problem once the framework ha been clearly defined, which should, in principle, be in the month of January.
We therefore propose postponing examination of this report.
Mr Lannoye ha just presented his Group' s request.
Is there a speaker to support this request?
Madam President, a we have already told the rapporteur and the House repeatedly, there is an important piece of legislation on the release of genetically manipulated or modified micro-organisms, namely the report by David Bowe, which we are currently dealing with in the conciliation procedure.
This is the fundamental piece of legislation and it form the basis for any other piece of legislation governing genetically modified plants.
It is therefore only sensible, and indeed, right and proper, to wait until the end of the conciliation procedure, which will not be for another six week or so, and then take decision on all the other piece of legislation.
I therefore support Mr Lannoye' s amendment.
We shall now hear from the rapporteur, Mrs Klass, who, I believe, is opposed to postponing the report.
Madam President, I am against postponing the report, and I question the way in which this House works.
The report wa adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development by a good majority and with only two vote against.
We are now embarking on a discussion about the release directive 90/220, which is inappropriate.
We are referring here to the release directive, and according to the conciliation procedure, that is precisely what the speech will focus on.
We are doing exactly the same a we have already done in the case of forest and plant material, i.e. we are making reference to the horizontal directive.
Not voting on the report will lead to delays.
It will obstruct the trade in vine material in Europe, and so I believe that in the interest of the single market for Europe' s vine propagators, we must vote on our report.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Relating to Tuesday:
Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to move that a particular item be included in tomorrow morning 's debate, namely a statement from the Commission about an interview that Commissioner Verheugen gave to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last Friday, 20 October.
Mr Verheugen gave the impression that, according to the current state of play, the European Union will have ten new member by 2005 and, what is more, and this is more disturbing still, he called into question the significance of majority decision in the Council of Ministers, which is what we regard a the fundamental reform element to be dealt with at the Nice Summit.
He ha already been criticised within his own political circle for saying this.
We would urge the Commission to clarify matter tomorrow in it statement.
Regrettably, this is now the second time that Commissioner Verheugen ha said such contentious things.
He is obviously making a habit of putting his foot in it.
We urge the Commission to clarify it position.
Mr Poettering, in tomorrow' s debate, every speaker will be free to raise any issue and to address both the Council and the Commission.
Announcement of the removal of Mr Le Pen from office
Ladies and gentlemen, I must inform you that on Thursday, 19 October 2000, I received official notification from the competent authority of the French Republic of a ruling by the Council of State on 6 October 2000 rejecting the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen against the decree of the French Prime Minister on 31 March 2000 terminating his mandate a an elected representative to the European Parliament.
I must inform you that, since that time, I have received a copy of a request for clemency for Mr Le Pen presented to Mr Jacques Chirac, President of the French Republic, by Mr Charles de Gaulle, Mr Carl Lang, Mr Jean-Claude Martinez and Mr Bruno Gollnisch.
I shall give the floor to Mrs Ana Palacio Vallelersundi, chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to give u her view on the matter.
Madam President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, having deliberated at it sitting of 15 and 16 May, agreed to recommend that the announcement in plenary of Parliament' s confirmation of the removal of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen' s mandate be suspended.
I repeat, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market recommended that this announcement be suspended until the deadline period that Mr Le Pen wa given for appealing against the French Council of State had expired or until a decision by the latter.
And I am quoting word for word from the letter dated 17 May that you yourself, Madam President, read in plenary.
As you said, the Council of State rejected the appeal and we were duly informed of that rejection.
There is therefore no longer any reason for delaying this announcement in plenary, which is an obligatory act according to primary law, specifically paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the Act of 20 September 1976.
The request for a reprieve that you mentioned, Madam President, doe not alter this situation, a it is not a legal appeal.
As it name indicates, it is an act of the Prince, which doe not affect the decree from the French Government which, in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, must be announced in plenary.
Thank you, Mrs Palacio.
Consequently, pursuant to Article 12(2) of the Act of 20 September 1976 on the election of representative to the European parliament by direct universal suffrage, the European Parliament hereby take note of the notification by the French Government of the termination of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen' s mandate.
Mr Le Pen, please leave the Chamber forthwith. In order to ensure that these proceeding go ahead in an orderly manner without affecting the dignity of either this House or your own dignity, I propose to suspend the sitting for ten minutes.
(The sitting wa suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 5.50 p.m.)
Request for waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s immunity
The next item is the report (A5-0304/2000) by Mr MacCormick, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the request for the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s immunity.
Madam President, this issue arises from a request (announced by yourself to the House on 17 February) by the appropriate Portuguese authority seeking a waiver of the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira in respect of proceeding in Portugal concerning word spoken on a television programme some year ago.
The television programme involved a discussion about the respective role of politician and journalists.
Mr Pacheco Pereira in that debate made remark about a third party not participating in the debate, to which the third party took exception.
Initially, public criminal proceeding were initiated but these were dropped and there is now a private action taking place before the Cascais First Criminal Court.
This is therefore a case involving the exercise of freedom of speech in a political matter.
The immunity of Members of the House arise under Article 10 of the Protocol of the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities.
The substance of this, for our present purpose, is that Members of this Parliament enjoy in their own Member State the same immunity a would be enjoyed by member of the national parliament of the state in question.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, having looked into the matter, is satisfied that, upon an issue of the kind before us, Mr Pacheco Pereira, were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament, would enjoy immunity which could be waived only by the Portuguese Parliament.
Therefore, under our rules, he enjoys immunity which can be waived only by decision of this Parliament.
It is important that I should underline the point that immunity is not conceived a an advantage to a particular Member, which she or he may waive or assert a she or he chooses.
Rather, it is an immunity asserted by this House a a whole, in the interest of preserving the condition of effective, democratic politics and argument and of enabling this House, through it Members, to discharge it function properly in an all-Europe democracy.
Therefore it is for the House to decide whether the immunity ought to waived or not.
We do not do this arbitrarily.
We do it in accordance with precedence and practice established over many years.
The concluding section of my report ought to be read out: "It is indisputable that Dr Pacheco' s comment on a television programme on the press qualify a part of a political debate and therefore Paragraph 1 of Article 157 of the Portuguese constitution would be applicable.
Under that provision he would have enjoyed immunity were he a member of the Portuguese Parliament.
Accordingly, he doe enjoy immunity a a Member of the European Parliament in respect of statement made and opinion expressed in the television programme to which the case relates."
It ha been the practice of the House to insist upon upholding immunity in all case where to deny it would be to inhibit political activity of a legitimate and democratic kind.
On that ground, therefore, the Legal Affairs Committee ha unanimously come to the conclusion that, after considering the reason militating for or against the waiver of immunity, we recommend that the immunity of Mr Pacheco Pereira not be waived by Parliament.
Madam President, the case of Mr Pacheco Pereira ha been carefully examined by the Legal Affairs Committee: the recommendation, which wa approved and which is tabled before the House today, is not to reject the request for waiver of Parliamentary immunity.
The reason and justification for this are given in Mr MacCormick' s excellent report, and the ground are the following: influence deriving from nationality or affiliation to a particular party cannot, and must not, be permitted; the legal basis must be sound and final; immunity is not a Member' s personal privilege but a guarantee of the independence of Parliament and it Members in relation to other authorities; the date of the alleged deed and the personal desire of the interested party to relinquish their immunity are of no importance.
The reference made in the Protocol to national legislation doe not mean that the European Parliament is being passed over but is in connection with the procedure, while every Parliament - including, in the case in point, the European Parliament - preserve it authority in it autonomous decisions.
When all is said and done, Mr Pacheco Pereira wa performing a political activity and cannot therefore be considered responsible for any crime.
That is the position of the European People' s Party. We would also like to point out that, if Mr Pacheco Pereira had been Italian, proceeding would have been brought against him without the European Parliament knowing anything about it.
The Italian judiciary doe not ask for authorisation when the person in question is a Member of the European Parliament and ignores every principle of the respect due to this institution.
Some Members of Parliament have already been taken to court during this parliamentary term without a request being put forward for waiver of parliamentary immunity.
Personally, I wa not able to intervene to condemn these action in that it concerned member of my own party who have always been political targets, and my involvement would therefore have appeared exploitative.
However, the incident ha been repeated again, and this time, although the Member concerned is a member of the European People' s Party, he is not from the same political party or persuasion a I am in Italy.
Proceedings were brought against Mr Cocilovo without Parliament being informed, indeed in contempt of Parliament.
This is an extremely serious matter, Madam President, that you cannot ignore.
The autonomy of the European Parliament is at stake!
Madam President, I certainly do not require the two minute allocated to me because, after the explanation from Mr MacCormick and the additional explanation by Mr Zappalà, from the point of view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists of the European Parliament, there is no doubt that Mr Pacheco Pereira' s immunity should not be waived.
I would say that this is a really trivial issue, a few comment by a politician on a television programme, which have resulted in a criminal action that ha no grounds, and which are covered by the Portuguese constitution and by application of Community rule on the waiver of parliamentary immunity.
In short, here we have all the ingredient for Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity not to be waived and, therefore, the Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees with Mr MacCormick' s proposal that Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity should not be suspended.
Social policy agenda
The next item is the report (A5-0291/2000) by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the social policy agenda [COM(2000) 379 - C5-0508/2000 - 2000/2219(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, lady and gentlemen, may I first and foremost thank my fellow MEPs and the Commissioner together with her office for the excellent cooperation we have had in the framework of this report, and may I also seize this opportunity to express my gratitude for the contribution of the many NGOs, the social partner and the expert who have helped u formulate an ambitious social agenda on behalf of Parliament?
It ha often been said that 'social policy is a productive factor' and this is true, for a society with greater social cohesion is also a society which performs better.
However, social policy doe have it own rights; social policy must ensure that inequality are ironed out, that social cohesion is promoted and that people' s quality of life improves.
That is why this social agenda deserves a far more prominent position in European policy.
The Lisbon Summit ha given u the opportunity to lend more weight to social policy; we must seize that opportunity with both hands.
It wa with great delight that I noted that the Commission and the French Presidency want an ambitious social agenda, and I believe, Commissioner and Minister, that we fully endorse the objectives.
I would therefore like to use some of my speaking time in this debate to draw attention to a number of point which Parliament would like to reinforce in this agenda.
The first point relates to the strategy. The social agenda must raise the profile of social Europe among the citizens, and that is why we are in favour of defining measures, priority and instrument more clearly and with greater intensity.
We must be able to see where progress is being made; this progress must be measurable and the social agenda must be afforded centre stage in the political discussion at European level.
Hence our urgent appeal in favour of the introduction of a social scoreboard, similar to the one already in use in the internal market, which detail specific measures, expiry date and deadlines.
Hence also our appeal in favour of having social agenda discussion at the annual spring Summit.
Secondly, I would like to comment on the instruments.
It is true that the open method of coordination, which ha been used within the sphere of employment since Luxembourg, ha brought fantastic new opening in field which up to now were only subject to national authority.
We would therefore ask that this method be reinforced and, a ha now been decided by the Social Affairs Council, be applied to combat social exclusion and poverty.
Furthermore, we would very much like to see this major innovative method being deployed to make progress in the modernisation strategy of social security.
Thirdly, there is a 'but' .
Stressing the importance of this open coordination method doe not mean that this method should replace social legislation, because we should lay down social right in Europe too. We should have the nerve to formulate minimum social standard and draft social legislation which is necessary within the framework of a European internal market.
Parliament is of the opinion that the Commission could lend a helping hand here and there, for example where individual and collective workers' right are concerned, where more security in new type of labour are concerned, or a regard the protection of health and safety relating to new risk in the workplace.
In addition, we believe it is crucial that the European Commission should take the initiative to re-establish the link with the ' 92 recommendation in order to underpin Member States' effort to guarantee everyone a right to a reasonable income.
Only then can the fight against poverty be efficient.
Needless to say, the social partner are major player when it come to achieving this agenda, where lifelong learning is concerned for example, or the organisation of working time, and new form of work, and we hope that they will be prepared to negotiate within all these fields.
However, Commissioner, if this consultation doe not yield results, we would also ask the Commission to use it right of initiative to the full.
I would like to finish off by making two remarks: a we endeavour to achieve the European social agenda it is essential to establish a close partnership, a partnership between institutions, and with the Member States, the social partners, but also with the many social NGOs which have a key role to play in the realisation of the agenda.
Here too, we believe that Europe should take an initiative a a matter of urgency to reinforce this dialogue with the citizen and the dialogue with the social NGOs.
Finally, social policy should not be viewed in isolation. It must be integrated into all EU policies.
I am convinced that Europe will only be social when a social dimension is added to economic policy, competition policy, external policy and the entire enlargement discussion.
I hope, Minister, that the Council will be inspired by Parliament' s expectations, and I hope that you will succeed in setting ambitious goal at the Nice Summit for a European social agenda, which we can work towards together over the next couple of years.
Mr President, the proposed social agenda sent out a political message which did not go unheeded.
This issue provoked intense interest in society throughout Europe and the Committee on Women' s Rights ha taken account in it opinion of the numerous proposal submitted by representative of non-governmental organisation and civil society in general.
We hope that the application of the social agenda will also give citizen the chance to feel part of social Europe and to realise that the European Union intends to take positive action to continue raising standard of living, rather than merely guaranteeing minimum levels.
We must also make it clear that the social agenda doe not intend to impose a uniform social policy but to coordinate, support and boost national policy within a global framework for social development, because all Member States currently face common challenges, which are naturally of varying proportions, such a working structures, discrimination against citizen and gender inequalities.
The Committee on Women' s Rights maintains that the social agenda must focus all it idea and project on the qualitative and quantitative participation in the job market of woman of all age and from all social stratum and must therefore give priority to any measure which facilitate access to work, the sort of measure to which we refer in our opinion, such a making it easier to combine professional and family life or other personal choices.
The Committee on Women' s Rights also proposes that woman of all age and from all social stratum should have access to an adequate and dignified system of social protection.
We must not forget that woman are always the first to fall prey to economic crisis and the majority of our fellow citizen who are victim of social exclusion and poverty are women.
In our opinion we also support dialogue and cooperation with civil society, especially women' s organisation in country preparing to join the European family, because here too we must anticipate uniform development which follows in the footstep and adopts the rationale of the rest of Europe.
Before I give Mrs Péry the floor, on behalf of the Council, I have a few comment to make.
This is Mrs Péry' s third visit in succession to Parliament, and we welcome this.
That wa the first point I wanted to make.
The only explanation I have for this is that the culprit is always drawn back to the scene of the crime.
Mrs Péry wa Vice-President for some years, sat in this very chair, and we were always in a very safe pair of hand during difficult votes.
All the more reason why I am delighted to see you here today, Mrs Péry.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, lady and gentleman of the House, let me firstly thank you, Mr President, for this personalised introduction.
I am very pleased to be able to join you today for this important debate on the social agenda.
I must also say, however, that Elisabeth Guigou, the current Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, would have liked to have been able to attend proceeding here today in this institution to which she too once belonged and of which she ha fond memories, but her new duty require her to be in Paris today, and she ha therefore asked me to present her apologies.
Before going any further, I should like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker, and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and it chairman, on the report before u today, which testifies to the dynamism and great commitment of the European Parliament to the social agenda.
Following the informal Employment and Social Policy Council on 8 July this year in Paris, the Presidency invited all the party involved, the European Parliament, of course, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, both side of industry, NGOs, Council group and committees, to submit their proposals.
The European Parliament resolution on the social agenda which you are just about to adopt is a very ambitious contribution to our joint exercise.
The French Presidency welcome this text and undertakes to give it the utmost consideration in it work.
The informal Council meeting of 8 July, the September conference you hosted with the European Commission and Mr Briet' s tour of European capital have provided the basis for a number of comments.
Let me first make some general remark on the social agenda before covering the various individual areas, in a very succinct way, a befits my allotted speaking time.
I am happy to be able to say that all the party involved in social policy declared themselves in favour of drawing up an agenda.
This is intended to give a higher profile to European social policy and to make it more effective, preparing the European Union for the great shared challenge ahead.
The agenda is, of course, in keeping with the Lisbon conclusion and the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights, to ensure it effective implementation.
The area of action listed in the Commission communication were also subject to general agreement.
What debate there were did not involve the type of action to be undertaken but rather the method to be adopted in order to achieve the desired objectives.
I think we should adopt a pragmatic approach and overcome any misguidedly ideological rifts.
As you very rightly suggest in your resolution, thereby supporting the approach proposed by the European Commission, we shall continue to use the entire range of Community instrument available to us: social dialogue, legislation, coordination, convergence, information exchange and financing under Community fund and programmes.
It is up to u to determine, area by area and action by action, the instrument best suited to the desired objective.
I now come to my more specific comments, and firstly my comment on employment.
Employment is our number one priority, even if the method of tackling the problem is in flux.
Here, too, I noted unanimity on the need to continue and step up the Luxembourg process in the context of the objective established at the European Council in Lisbon.
We are particularly committed to the objective of full employment.
It is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality, and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective: more job and better jobs.
It fall to u to define the key element which characterise the quality of employment and then to be capable of measuring these.
You will understand, given my duty a a member of the French Government, that I wa particularly pleased to note that, firstly, the equality of men and woman and, secondly, lifelong training are two area which receive very strong support.
The subject of lifelong training wa unanimously adopted a a priority area.
Moreover, the two side of industry have undertaken to work on this subject.
We must encourage them to do so in order to ensure that initiative by collective agreement are taken to promote lifelong training within the shortest possible time limits.
Let me, at this point, remind you that there will be a European Seminar on this subject on 4 and 5 December in Biarritz, which I shall be chairing.
On the subject of the equality of men and women, many Member States stressed the need for a better coordination of work and family life, particular with regard to childcare.
This is indeed a key issue, both in order to increase employment rate and in order to make progress towards male-female equality.
To stay on this subject a moment, your resolution provides for many measure in favour of woman and contains one general objective to include the concept of male-female equality in all the sector covered by the agenda.
I support this method.
As you perhaps know, on 27 October, I am holding a ministerial symposium on this subject.
I already spoke at length on this subject at your plenary sitting on October 5.
I shall not therefore remind you of the three area that we shall be debating at this meeting.
You will shortly be discussing the fifth gender equality programme for 2001-2006.
I should like to thank you most sincerely for responding to the Presidency' s invitation by working very quickly and very successfully, enabling u to adopt this most important programme, which proposes both an integrated approach and specific actions, on time.
You can count on me to make every effort to complete the task successfully and to support the financial commitment of EUR 50 million.
Finally, in order to step up the integrated approach to equality, the Presidency wa in favour of implementing this concept in a number of meeting of the Council of Ministers.
This is something that will be done under the French Presidency.
The social agenda ha many more objectives.
Let me just mention the mobility of workers.
Freedom of movement must be encouraged, while ensuring that career path are safeguarded.
I should also like to briefly point out our fight against insecurity and insecure employment. This must be dealt with better.
Both side of industry pointed out the need for common definitions.
I am thinking in particular of non-standard work.
Plainly, a number of Community Directives on European work councils, transfer and mass redundancies, for example, need to be updated.
I also noted a strong desire for definition of a genuine Community strategy on the working environment, particularly concerning health and safety.
Existing directive must be simplified and adapted to technical progress, but practical proposal must also be made on emerging risk or dangerous jobs.
Let me say something about social protection.
We all agree that we should pursue the strategy of cooperation in social protection, paying special attention, a we were urged at Lisbon, to the issue of pensioners.
At the Employment and Social Policy Council held on 17 October, a great deal of progress wa made in the fight against exclusion by defining appropriate objective for the fight against poverty and social exclusion, which will serve a a foundation for national action plans.
The agenda could also give an opinion on the follow up to be given to the 1992 recommendation on minimum resources.
Within the next few weeks, the Presidency intends to draw up a general report on all these subjects, in the light of the contribution submitted to us.
We should be able to successfully complete a document intended for the Heads of State and Government by the time of the Employment Council on 28 November. This document should express some real ambition for the next five years.
Quite clearly, the European Parliament will have made a significant contribution, and I thank you for this.
Mr President, today we are debating social policy.
I would like to warmly thank Mrs Van Lancker and Mrs Kratsa for the huge effort they have made in order to set down thought from within Parliament on paper.
I would like to make two observation in this regard.
Firstly, we used to debate the social action programme, and an action programme implies that something is done.
We are now discussing the social agenda and this could mean that something is done, but not necessarily, and so this is one of the aspect which we need to continually bear in mind.
We are dealing with a Socialist-inspired Council, so chance are that there will be a lot of talk and little action.
I hope I will be proved wrong.
What matter is that something is put on the agenda and that something is done.
This is the aim of this report and we have tried to emphasise this in a number of amendments.
Today we are discussing social policy, a the rapporteur pointed out earlier.
In our Group, we have always set great store by the social market economy a a basis for everything we do, also within the framework of the European Union.
Fortunately, we have largely managed to bring about the common market.
We have also managed to bring about a few thing in the social sphere, but not everything, and this wa because the Treaty of Amsterdam had not taken effect at the time; so, in this light, the social action programme or this social agenda is of particular significance.
We need to try to list and identify the gap left in the system, and at least put them on the agenda.
The importance of drafting an agenda is that we can include item which we hope the Commission will develop further.
A number of such point are included.
It would have been very wrong on the part of this Parliament not to make any mention of these points, but I am aware that we have not yet solved all the problem related to these points.
It is thus something which we are passing on to the Commission for further examination.
I would now like to turn to the point of open coordination which I believe is crucial. In fact, I would also like to refer to the recommendation made by Mr Cocilovo, which admittedly is not being discussed here but which will be voted on later.
In particular, his recommendation responds to Parliament' s observation on employment.
This is why little mention is made of this in the present report.
However, these two recommendation should actually be seen a one entity for the picture to be complete.
I think there are some problem left unsolved, but these will need to be addressed in the course of the vote on the amendments.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker on producing an excellent report.
I have heard from some quarter that having read the report, they agree with the diagnosis but not with the prescription.
I take the view that unless we follow this prescription then the prognosis is not good for the stated aim of the social agenda, which is to make sure that social policy ha a full and equal place alongside employment and economic policy.
This is the prescription we need to follow.
For the Socialist Group there are many very important point in this report.
For u the open coordination method is very important.
We want to see it strengthened in relation to employment.
We want to see it also applied to social exclusion and social protection.
I am glad to hear what Nicole Perry had to say to u today in that respect.
Open coordination seems to be regarded by many a a soft option and I have no doubt that is why it is being supported in certain quarters.
It cannot be a soft option.
We will insist at every possible opportunity that it ha to entail indicator and benchmark and proper peer-group review and that there should be a part for Parliament in that procedure.
We also support social dialogue but we insist that the Commission should manage that procedure properly and that where negotiation fail we should have an expeditious introduction of legislation where necessary.
Paragraph 14 list a number of point we think are important.
I cannot go into them all in the time available but let me stress for u the importance of those paragraph relating to the need to update the framework of legislation relating to restructuring.
Again I wa pleased to hear what Nicole Perry ha said today.
I have not heard similarly encouraging thing so far from the Commission in relation to, for example, the need to update the European Works Council Directive, or relating to collective redundancy and transfers.
We also, of course, place considerable emphasis upon the general framework relating to information and consultation to make sure that industrial change is managed with social responsibility.
Mr President, a far a the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is concerned, it is crucial that the Europe of the future should also be a social Europe.
The political task is therefore to find the best way of achieving that objective.
For u in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, it is important that decision should be taken a close to the people a possible. This applies especially to labour market and social policy.
At the Lisbon Summit this spring, the EU' s Heads of Government adopted a far-sighted vision for the development of a social Europe. Importance wa attached to promoting the EU' s position in the knowledge society, a it wa to open coordination in pursuit of common objectives, but with flexibility and freedom in the choice of resources.
This wa established a a leading principle.
In it communication, the Commission ha found a framework for the social agenda which I think admirably reflects the spirit of the Lisbon Summit.
In our view, open coordination is the correct route to go down if we are to secure a social Europe.
There may be a need for legislation in some areas, but we have no need for a host of bureaucratic and constricting rule which bring European cooperation into discredit without producing real results.
I also want to express my appreciation of the major effort which Mrs Van Lancker ha put into drawing up the report.
Her contribution ha been very constructive, and if my Group is sceptical about a number of the main element in her report, that is because we disagree politically, and that is, of course, understandable.
We do not therefore share the report' s predilection for legislation at EU level.
There are a number of area in which we feel that too much detail is gone into.
I want to emphasise that, in the EU countries, we have different tradition and different problem in the area of the labour market and social policy, and the decision of the Lisbon Summit acknowledge this.
The Commission' s proposal strike a good balance.
Technological development and new method of organisation call, of course, for flexible cooperation in which we concentrate more on objective and on achieving result and le upon rigid regulation.
Open coordination of this kind is not necessarily devoid of obligation.
Of course, it must be binding, but it must be constructed from the bottom up and not developed by u specifying a host of rule and quota centrally.
Specifically, open coordination must be open both in the choice of resource and in the way in which everyone concerned is involved.
It is therefore important that more public interest be created for open coordination and that the latter should be focused on to a greater degree, whether it be in employment policy or with regard to the issue of social exclusion which we are now addressing and to which open coordination can also be applied.
It should not be secretive.
The process should be much better known, and it is here that I think Parliament ha something to offer.
It can make the process more transparent and give it more public focus.
Mr President, first of all, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to thank Anne Van Lancker and congratulate her on the quality of her report both in term of it content and the inclusive way she strove to work on it.
The apparently technical term 'social agenda' in fact cover the day-to-day reality experienced by our fellow citizens.
We must both respond to the urgent situation and give practical shape to what ha been called the notorious European 'social model' .
We have no right to miss this deadline unless we intend to shatter the expectation of all the citizen and the collective movement they have formed, which are the group most motivated to establish a European Union which is a community of citizens.
The issue to be discussed select themselves: we simply need to respond to the urgency of the situation and bring in legislation to match the declaration made at the Lisbon Summit.
We must give the people of Europe the tool and the public policy they need in order to fashion their own place within Europe, in order to ensure that their fundamental rights, including social rights, are safeguarded.
The urgency of the social situation and the need to defend the European social model call for initiative that aim to establish rights: the right to an income, the right to a wage, the right to decent pension for all within the European Union.
Implementing the ambition for society declared in Lisbon call for an effort on the part of the Community, an action plan to create job in services, especially those related to the information society.
As far a that is concerned, the directive proposed in the report in order to guarantee the social protection of new form of working is essential.
It is also important to ensure quality in health, an improved social situation, and an improved environment for everyone - the third system - and tax and legislative measure are essential in order to ensure both the economic longevity and the visibility of this emerging economy of solidarity.
We support Anne Van Lancker and Mrs Péry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the European Works Council Directive.
The fundamental notion of the general interest ought, moreover, to spur u all to approve the proposal to include recital relating to employment in the regulation and decision on the merger currently dictated by consideration of competitiveness.
These three example intended to combat poverty, support the development of activity for job creation, social liaison and quality of life, and to improve employees' rights, should harness the support of a Parliament that is anxious to propagate the dream of a Europe of the Citizens, although these same citizen currently all too often feel that Europe is a machine commercialising all human activity.
A number of amendment betray the terror of some of our fellow Members who get their eraser out a soon a they see the word 'legislation' .
Are they going to go and explain to the people of Europe that Parliament deems it necessary to vote through directive to protect investment and liberalise general interest services, but not to define and regulate what ha been described here a the labour market?
Such a rejection of legislation, moreover, lead to a plain rejection of negotiation. We even have one amendment that go a far a proposing to eliminate the objective of concluding European collective agreement between the two side of industry.
It is in this area that we can, in our opinion, find the kind of old-fashioned idea attributed to those who expect a brave new world to spring out of a free market.
Mr President, there really is a need for a social agenda in Europe after many year of neo-liberal economic policy which ha lead to unemployment and social exclusion everywhere, including in my own affluent country, Sweden.
Begging ha returned to our large town after having disappeared from them a long ago a the immediate post-war years.
Even the private charitable organisation and their soup kitchen appear to be needed again.
I must therefore welcome the purpose of the Commission' s work and of Mrs Van Lancker' s report.
Many of her proposal are extremely commendable and deserve our full support.
Genuine social initiative cost a lot of money, a factor which I think is discussed far too little in the report.
These resource must come mainly from the Member States. It is therefore the social authority in each country upon whom demand must essentially be made.
Governments must set aside more resources, more social worker must be appointed and more resource must be given to the voluntary social organisations. Otherwise, the result will be fine word without any practical content.
Mrs Van Lancker' s report present the Commission and it legislation a the real engine of social work.
I believe that the impetus must come from below and that it is a question of providing aid at a problem level.
The Commission can obviously make an important contribution, but the social problem have their root in local condition and must be handled with great sensitivity for the practical condition concerned.
The Commission can help set a high standard, but it is social workers, the union and voluntary activist we must pin our hope on, and not official in Brussels.
Finally, I would just add that I am not a co-author of Amendment No 35 a stated in the document with the amendments.
On the contrary, I am very critical of the amendment.
The name Figueiredo should be there instead of my own name.
The Secretariat must have made a mistake, and I would ask for this to be corrected.
Mr President, I welcome the publication this year of the new European Union social policy agenda for the year 2000-2005.
This received fresh impetus at the Lisbon European Council meeting of the European Union leader earlier this year.
Key priority in this agenda include the following: an increased role will be given to the social partner in term of drafting EU directive and regulations.
Employee relation will be improved.
There will be continued European Union support for local job creation programmes.
New EU mechanism for mediation, arbitration and conciliation will be drafted.
A new EU charter for small business will be put in place.
There will be improved coordination of policy programme in the area of the information society.
And there will be a modernising of telecommunication service and Internet-related activities.
From an Irish perspective I would like to say to the Members of the House that one of the reason why there ha been such strong economic progress in our country is the fact that we have had a system of social partnership in place since 1987.
This ha meant that the government ha worked closely with the trade union and employee group on a whole range of economic and social activity in an effort to secure broad agreement in matter such a pay and condition for employee in Ireland.
This ha certainly helped to reduce industrial unrest in our country and ha contributed to increased inward investment programme from abroad.
I would also welcome the commitment of this policy agenda to the modernisation of telecommunication services.
The European Union must take advantage of the new and evolving technology which are coming on stream at this time.
I welcome the publication of the new framework programme of telecommunication regulation and directive which wa published in July of this year by the Commission.
Parliament is presently deliberating on seven different telecommunication regulation and is due to give an opinion on these matter before Christmas.
As regard e-commerce, it is fair to say that the United States of America had a head start on the European Union.
However, the European Union is catching up fast and the implementation of a broad range of telecommunication directive and regulation would certainly assist in this process.
Finally, I would like to commend the Commissioner for consumer protection, Mr Byrne, for his effort in trying to secure an agreement on how best to move forward on regulating a vast structure for e-commerce transaction now and for the future.
Mr President, for almost half a century European integration ha been based on the economy.
Indeed we spoke of a European Economic Community.
The priority wa given to setting up a common market, with the principle of the free movement of property, good and capital, the establishment of rule governing competition between firm and state aid.
Social policy served to mitigate the most damaging effect of economic policies.
The provision enshrined in the Treaty of Rome were confined to the principle of equal pay for men and woman (Article 141) and the freedom of movement of workers.
The Commission communication and Mrs Van Lancker' s report have the merit of remedying this imbalance by acknowledging the interaction between social and economic policy and employment policy.
Mrs Van Lancker' s report is an ambitious one. The rapporteur effectively asks the Commission to intensify the agenda, chiefly in the following areas: Employment, with the framing of a European pact for employment and social cohesion, a concern lifelong training and the introduction of prior cross-border testing of social and fiscal legislation.
Next, in the area of social dialogue, this intensification would be expressed by adopting a directive on employee information and consultation, and the European Works Council Directive, with a revision of the directive on redundancies.
Finally, in the area of social protection, it would take the form of pursuing a strategy of convergence.
It is a veritable catalogue of measure which is more a declaration of intent than a plan that could be implemented in the medium term.
In conclusion, the objective of giving new impetus to European social policy in the face of globalisation, enlargement and an ageing population is a laudable one.
It demonstrates that economic competitiveness and social cohesion are not mutually exclusive.
The method used, on the other hand, seems more debatable.
Regarding the financing of NGOs and their participation in Community policies, there is still no legal basis in the Treaty, paragraph 13.
Similarly, with the new social agenda, there is a desire to pas legislation at Community level, at the risk of harmonising to minimum standard and short-circuiting social relation within the Member States.
Before we continue with the agenda, there is something I would like to say.
Due to the fact that we have wasted another 40 minute today on a debate about the Rules of Procedure, we are now hopelessly behind schedule.
I must therefore ask you to stick religiously to your speaking time, so a to ensure that the sitting now proceeds in an orderly manner.
Can you please discus within your respective group whether it is constructive to have forty minute of moaning and groaning at the beginning of every sitting, before getting down to business.
The only people that suffer are you, who want to engage in political debate.
Mr President, if the rapporteur will allow me I will start by saying where I agree with her and - if the rapporteur will forgive me - that may not take long.
Of course, colleague and I share her ideal for a better standard of living for all the people of Europe, for a better quality of life and for promotion of social inclusion.
Where I part company is on her proposal or - a Stephen Hughes said - her prescription to secure that end, because her proposal will lead u further away from those ideal rather than towards achievement.
Various speaker have talked about the Lisbon Summit today. That wa hailed six month ago a a very important summit.
Mention wa made there of a new direction for Europe: moving away from the social regulation agenda of the 1980s towards enterprise, innovation, competition and employment.
However, the report say something slightly different: whereas Lisbon call for a reform of the social model, it call for reinforcement; whereas Lisbon call for liberation of enterprise and more flexibility, the report proposes four new or amended directive and a number of legislative initiatives.
The report set out the standard Socialist solution throughout the age of legislation, legislation, legislation.
What we need to pursue our common goal is not more regulation, but less.
We do not want more burdening of business, we want less.
We do not want more unemployment, we want less.
The original Commission proposal wa much better left unamended - congratulation Commissioner.
I propose that we leave it unamended and we reject the report, otherwise we will give the clearest possible signal that Parliament is continuing to pursue the old agenda.
Surely it is time to move on.
Mr President, the Commission ha tabled a very ambitious proposal, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for combining great understanding of national difference with considerable determination, without which this would never have been anything other than a pretty piece of paper.
I should also like to thank the other Anna for the substantial work she ha done on this matter, something we could not have done without.
The debate today and in the Committee show that there are major political difference and major difference in ambition in this area, and I think it good that these difference should be clearly brought out.
In this way, people have a clear choice when they vote at the next parliamentary election: a choice between those who want to see a social Europe and those who merely want the EU to regulate the internal market. A choice between right and left.
Our fellow MEPs from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and, in particular, from the British Conservative Party, have re-tabled a series of amendment which would genuinely weaken the ambition of this social action programme.
Every time legislation is proposed, these Thatcher-inspired neo-liberals embark upon an ideological crusade.
Europe doe not deserve dogmatism, however.
What Europe need is for u to ass pragmatically what regulatory tool will be the most effective in the practical situation.
In some cases, we need the open coordination method.
On other occasions, it is better for the two side of industry to negotiate their way towards an agreement.
We must not, however, be afraid to use legislation if this is what is required for u to achieve our objectives.
I also want to raise another practical issue which this strategy ha focused upon.
This is the need to come up with a definite strategy for the working environment which would give u the opportunity to devise a coherent policy in this area.
Within the area of the working environment, too, we must make a practical assessment of which tool are best for solving the various problems.
Here, too, dogmatism is not the way forward but, rather, finding pragmatic solution to real problems.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, I feel that the Lisbon Summit ha presented u with a picture of a future Europe which cannot, which must not be purely an economic Europe, but which must be a genuine political entity.
And in order to be a political entity, Europe must have a cultural and social, a well a economic structure.
In my opinion, therefore, the proposal presented by the Commission on the social agenda is extremely positive.
However, I do agree with almost all of Mrs Van Lancker' s report - and for this I am grateful to her - for I do not believe that when Mrs Van Lancker make a specific reference to clear objectives, proposal for specific instrument and, in particular, precise deadlines, that she is reverting to the socialist logic of old, a somebody ha suggested today.
It is rather that she is simply reverting to a longstanding need, the need for cohesion in a situation which, from this point of view, is becoming increasingly difficult to regulate because it lack any form of harmonisation.
In discussing a Charter of Fundamental Rights and advocating a European Constitution we cannot shy away from certain issues: we have to insist that all the necessary measure must be taken, even if this mean producing more accurate legislation.
I do not believe that Mrs Van Lancker intends to create law to regulate absolutely everything; I feel rather that she considers it necessary, when coordinating action do not produce the desired results, when the citizen encounter inequality between the States and when there is no social harmonisation, to bring about this harmonisation.
The issue of open coordination must therefore be tackled alongside a comprehensive action to develop social legal bases, for without them we will not be able to persuade the States to harmonise a social policy which upholds equality and equal opportunities.
Mr President, now that we have had a return to growth, it is crucial for the European Union to provide itself with the mean to meet expectation in the social sector.
The Commission communication highlight a raft of ambitious objectives, such a full employment, equal opportunities, training, etc., but there are many contradiction between the European Union' s declared ambition and it political decisions.
Among other aspects, let me cite the concern for productivity, which generally involves wage moderation a a priority.
I would therefore like to join my fellow Members in congratulating Anne Van Lancker on her report, which open up new perspectives, with an approach which aim for greater precision and greater coherence.
Her report appreciably build on the Commission' s proposal by suggesting the harmonisation of social regulation and the coordination of national social legislation.
It call for a genuine European agreement to be framed in favour of employment and social cohesion and proposes initiative on the gradual reduction of working time prior to retirement, the introduction of a minimum wage and cross-border supervision in relation to social and fiscal law.
This is all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intention and actually take practical action.
Moreover, at a time when a great many employee of major European industrial group face redundancy plan in the context of merger and restructuring, I think it important for the report on the social agenda to take a stand in favour of taking social clause into consideration in competition policy, in favour of directive to this end and in favour of a revision of the European Works Council Directive a well a the directive on redundancies.
This, I feel, is part of the consistent approach which we are lacking.
I am pleased to see, furthermore, that Mrs Van Lancker ha included a number of amendment tabled by my Group, particularly that on factoring in the social dimension of enlargement and incorporating the right to strike into Community legislation.
Together with my Group, I have tabled some amendment criticising the Commission' s approach calling for the adoption of wage restraint.
I advocate the reduction of working time without a concomitant reduction in salaries.
Having said that, I support Anne Van Lancker' s report, which ha the great merit of adopting an ambitious social policy backed up by specific objective which go beyond the usual purely formal declarations.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker, who ha supplemented the Commission's already excellent report with amendment tabled by myself.
Naturally, I am very pleased about this: it is just a pity that the amendment which are most important in my opinion have not been included.
I listened with pleasure to Mrs Péry' s brief summary of the Council' s social policy, which I firmly support.
I am very familiar with the project and support all the work carried out by Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou to date. She will remember that I asked her, one day, whether her attitude to pensioners' issue wa that of a fairy godmother or a wicked stepmother.
Up until now, I feel I can say that she ha been a fairy godmother: two week ago, she announced that the Commission had programmed a special undertaking to resolve the problem of pensioner by extending the directive on pension fund and via the proposal to regulate these European pension fund in such a way that they are used to benefit worker who have hitherto paid a large part of their salary to the State, to the different States, and who would have liked - and this is what I propose - their fund to be properly managed, just as, I am sure, Mrs Diamantopoulou manages the finance of her own family and a every bank, every British bank, in particular - and on this point I agree with Mr Bushill-Matthews - ha done thus far.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, there are two people here today who deserve special congratulations, one being Anna Lancker, for her outstanding report, and the other being Anna Diamantopoulou, for her outstanding submission.
It is an ambitious agenda, and I still have a clear recollection of the painfully slow progress that wa made during the last legislative period in the sphere of social protection.
The Council wa not even prepared to discus the matter at the time.
What is clearly new is that we have adopted an employment policy, based on the Lisbon Decisions, indeed an employment policy that should be of a qualitative nature.
We do not want over-regulation - and I say this to the British delegate who spoke before - but the diversity of modern contract of employment requires new form of social protection, and not the rule of the nineteenth century.
We also stand to gain a great deal from having a constructive and effective policy mix between economic and financial policy, and, not least, from developing the social economy and the service sector.
What is not so new, and the subject of repeated demands, is lifelong learning - which is something even the smallest Member States have done something about - a are the long overdue reform to the European factory committee law, the legal protection of nursing and expectant mothers, and freedom of movement.
I would like to raise a criticism in connection with the lack of initiative produced in response to the new challenge we face in health and safety at work, employee participation and labour relations.
Of course, I wa delighted to see the French Presidency show such commitment to the issue of childcare, family and women' s policy.
Perhaps it ha something to do with the fact that all three people responsible - in the Commission, Parliament and the Council - are women.
But what we need now, in tandem with this, are instrument that allow for the involvement of fathers.
That would be a new departure.
Besides, this agenda should send out a signal to the candidate countries, and I therefore wish it every success.
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, lady and gentlemen, the citizen of the European Union expect more than just vague commitment that are then forgotten and which are rarely converted into binding instrument or decision that bring about a real improvement in the quality of their life and of their work. In order to dispel any lack of confidence, this social agenda must enable objective and policy that have been postponed for year to be put into practice.
The Council must not leave various specific proposal that have been postponed year after year simply hanging in the air.
I have in mind proposal on decision that are crucial to improving the right of working woman who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and vital for improving workers' collective and individual rights, including the right to information, consultation and participation, specifically in the framework of the European Company Statute and of the European Works Council. This is necessary from the point of view of guaranteeing workers' right and preventing redundancy a a result of successive merger and relocation by multinationals in various European countries.
As the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, emphasises, although social dialogue is important, it must produce tangible results.
Otherwise, the Commission will have to propose legislative instrument and the Council will have to approve the measure needed, specifically by amending macroeconomic policy and the Stability Pact, in order to give credibility to our fight against poverty and social exclusion and to our effort to defend good quality job with respectable salary and to advocate reform that give employee dignity.
Mr President, I think that the social policy agenda is positive for everyone.
I think that harmonising the social policy of the different Member States cannot do anything other than benefit all Europeans. It will be particularly beneficial in all aspect relating to employment, which, since the Lisbon Summit, we know is a priority for the whole of the European Union.
I would like to particularly stress the benefit which, in term of employment, can be obtained by woman through giving them improved access to employment with guarantee in term of working time and salary.
I think that there is also a great advantage, if we succeed in getting the directive applied, modified and updated, with regard to maternity leave: for woman to receive help during maternity and for maternity to be protected when woman have to continue working during that period.
I also think that it will be very positive in term of helping woman to reconcile family and working life.
It is going to enable woman to continue in their job without neglecting their family obligations.
Neither can we forget what the e-Europe initiative mean for new jobs, new technology and the information society, where I think woman have an important role to play.
These are new job where people can work from home with regulation that help to reconcile working life with family life.
All these coordinated social policy action will also help to combat poverty and social exclusion.
I think that we should all welcome the arrival of this social policy agenda.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commissioner and Mrs Péry on this presentation of the social agenda.
I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identifies instruments, sector of intervention and timeframes and guarantee positive, dynamic interaction between economic, social and employment policies.
These instrument are intended to adapt the European social model in line with the changing reality.
I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report and I would like, in particular, to stress a point which has, moreover, already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mrs Péry in their speeches, and that is the need for all the instrument to be genuinely implemented at European level, and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension.
This is what happens in many countries.
In conclusion, I would like to give an example: last week, the Italian Parliament adopted a new law on welfare which wa proposed by a Minister - a woman, like the three representative of the three institutions. This is tantamount to a revolution, for the old law on welfare had been in force for over 100 years.
Mr President, the Commission draft on the socio-political agenda contains many positive concept such a full employment, quality of work, social quality and modernisation of social protection.
But it lack substance to some extent.
Mrs Van Lancker' s outstanding report make good the deficiency of the Commission draft a regard content.
We support a pact for employment and social cohesion, a European action plan for employment with a view to boosting the social economy and local employment initiatives, social regulation for new form of working such a tele-working and new form of self-employment, the minimum wage, and guaranteed income.
The European Union ha already stood idly by for far too long, watching poverty and social exclusion take hold in the Member States.
Indeed Mrs Van Lancker' s proposal for improving the information available to, and participation of, female employees, and for social clause in public contracts, merger and international agreements, are long overdue.
We object to the fact that the Commission and the Council are unwilling to make additional resource available for the social agenda.
Social quality cannot be achieved free and gratis.
It sometimes seems to me that the concept of modernisation is often tantamount to the undermining of social protection.
Extending people' s working life is not modernisation, no more so is funding pension by freezing or lowering the statutory pension level, and advising people to take up investment opportunity on the financial markets.
We need modern, European social harmonisation, not deregulation.
Mr President, I have one minute and three point to make. Firstly, I should like to thank Mrs van Lancker on the work she ha done in producing this excellent report.
As for my second point, I wish to restate my Group' s fundamental convictions.
The working area opened up in the social agenda must be given a coherent, and certainly conciliatory, legal framework: The policy of convergence and the policy of coordination which have been initiated, and also supported by legislative measures, when necessary, which in turn should be reinforced by genuinely stringent monitoring methods.
As for my third point, there are some right that have simply been glossed over from the viewpoint of a social Europe: the right to a minimum income, the information and consultation of employees, the European collective agreement.
These are point which, we know, are contested by the conservative in Europe, but to which we, in our Group, attach great importance.
Minister, Commissioner, we must continue to adopt an ambitious approach on these issues.
I hope, Minister, that in Nice the French Presidency will succeed in pushing through an ambitious social agenda, since embarking on the construction of a social Europe is still the great hope of all our fellow citizens.
Mr President, I should like to extend my special thanks both to the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, and the French Presidency for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed to date.
I shall try very briefly to pinpoint a few political aspect of the four area touched on in greater or lesser detail by all the speakers, i.e. the new political approach in the social agenda, secondly the content, thirdly the mean and fourthly the procedures.
As far a the political approach is concerned, we need, I think, to highlight two new elements.
The first is that, since Lisbon, the new approach to social policy is to deal with it not a a product or by-product of economic policy, but a a policy in it own right which need to be exercised in tandem with economic policy and the employment strategy.
In other words, this is the only way for u to deal with Europe' s objective of competitiveness, given our constant concern for enterprise and the economy, and social cohesion, given our constant concern for our citizen and their welfare.
The second element in the new approach is quality. Quality a a new political concept to deal with working conditions, employment relation and the service of the social state.
These two political approach underpin the entire content.
What are the basic strand which make up the content?
There are three.
A set of project and proposal on employment.
I think that what we are endeavouring to achieve through the employment strategy, by strengthening and enriching it a we progress - because the entire social agenda is a process of dynamic change - is to support competitiveness and entrepreneurship in the European Union and flexibility on the job market, alongside security, mobility and new working models, and to support and analyse new social partnership model and the impact of competitiveness and major restructuring on employment and the social state.
The second strand to the social agenda is a set of project on social policy.
Here I would like to refer to the proposal for combating poverty and exclusion, the new work which we have started on pension and social protection, policy for people with special need and, more importantly, I would like to pinpoint a particular political aspect, i.e. the need for a new approach to social policy.
We must not simply calculate the cost of social policy, which is often seen from several political angle a an obstacle to economic development; we must calculate the cost of not implementing social policy.
I think that this analysis will give u new, interesting result and approaches.
The third strand in the content is enlargement.
To be brief, social policy, the new social standard and harmonisation of the social legislation of candidate country with the Member States are one of the most important feature of the enlargement procedure and we must not lose sight of that.
This brings me to the third area which ha engaged our attention today and throughout our cooperation: the means.
I think that the discussion on deregulation and legislation, i.e. do we or do we not need legislation, is old hat.
Clearly we have a fairly complete legislative system in Europe, but change on the job market, change in the economy, change in the environment due to globalisation and the information society are throwing up new requirements.
When we need to deal with these new requirement with legislation, we shall not, of course, have any hesitation in doing so.
If we can deal with them in other way and with other methods, we shall do so.
The proposal for a scoreboard, for a specific method for monitoring the social agenda, is a huge challenge.
The problem is that, because of the legal basis which it ha in the Treaty, the social agenda doe not constitute a set of laws, a set of directive with specific step for the Member States.
It is still hard for u to define European objective which are equally valid for all the Member States because the situation on the ground varies.
We therefore believe that, in the first instance, common European indicators, a project which is now nearing completion, and national objectives, i.e. the need for each country to have it own scoreboard and carry out monitoring, are a step along the road to providing u with specific results.
Finally, a far a procedure are concerned, I really must congratulate Parliament on it initiative in starting a dialogue with the civil society and the important contribution which this dialogue made to the agenda, a well a highlight the discussion which took place with Parliament, with the Member States and with the social partner at European and national level; this is how we were able to combine national idiosyncrasy and ensure, above all, that the Agenda is not merely ambitious but flexible and efficient.
And one last comment: the question of sexual equality run right through the social agenda a regard both the political approach and the content and means.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your interesting speech.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005)
The next item is the report (A5-0294/2000) tabled by Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Programme relating to the Community framework strategy on gender equality (2001-2005) [COM(2000) 335 - C5-0386/2000 - 2000/0143 (CNS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, lady and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see you all here.
The Commission' s communication affirms that democracy is a fundamental value of the EU Member States, the EEA States and the candidate countries, a well a a key part of external relation and development cooperation in the Union.
It also affirms that real democracy requires all citizens, woman and men alike, to participate and be represented equally in the economy, decision making and social, cultural and civil life.
There are major deficiency in all these areas. The Commission therefore proposes to tackle the problem with a combination of measures.
In tandem with integrating equality perspective into all policy area - what is normally called gender mainstreaming - specific measure for woman will be implemented.
I fully endorse that strategy and approach and consider that it is not an exaggeration to say that no effort to promote gender equality are of lasting value unless women' s right are strengthened at the same time.
This work ha gone quite quickly despite the fact that it took a little time at the beginning.
The Committee ha submitted 49 amendments.
At the beginning we had 126, which indicates that we are incredibly committed.
I am very pleased about this.
We believe, for example, that it is very important for the Commission to guarantee maximum openness around this programme so that all interested party can keep abreast of proceeding throughout the implementation phase.
It is also incredibly important, not to say fundamental, that the various Community actions, the framework strategy and the Member States' measure complement, and do not counteract, each other.
This is, of course, also the Commission' s and the Council' s express ambition.
The Commission ha now identified five focus area of strategic importance.
I have no objection in this respect, nor ha the Committee.
We have come up with a new shock proposal, which is really a reiteration of what wa stated in our opinion on the budget.
We believe that 40 per cent of the Structural Funds should be earmarked to focus on women' s condition and needs.
The Commission' s proposed measure should be expanded to include review of individual access to medical and health care and to social security and pensions, an analysis of shortcoming in the organisation of work and perhaps also a study of the significance of a general reduction in working hours.
What we have just recently discussed here in this Chamber are, of course, the social issues, and I wish once again to emphasise the repeated observation that over 50 million EU citizen are, in fact, classified a poor and that a large majority of those are women.
This is, of course, something which need not only to be observed but also to be combated, and with the help of vigorous measures.
We have had a lot of detailed discussion of various assessment procedures.
I shall not go into any more detail here. Rather, I just wanted to mention it.
We have touched upon the idea that the plan must be to increase accessibility and also scope for active participation for non-governmental organisations.
Discussions have been held a to how the candidate country can be incorporated in the programme in a natural way.
We have also discussed what we must do in order not only to give a mention to woman in the developing country but also to be able to do something practical in this area.
During the final phase of the journey, I have been in very close contact with people in both the Commission and the Council.
We naturally want to include the strategy in the Council decision, too.
What we mean in the Committee by strategy is, of course, not the Commission' s opening gambit, but that strategy beginning a from paragraph 2 ( 'The Strategy' ).
I am saying this so that no mysterious or technical procedure cause this to be misunderstood, for no le than seven different amendment in the same spirit have been tabled.
In other words, the Council too must adopt the Commission' s strategy.
It is therefore important that non-governmental organisation should obtain influence in the course of implementation.
One amendment is to the effect that it should be possible to hold an annual debate here in Parliament, together with the Commission.
This perhaps affect only the Commission and Parliament, but I am very grateful indeed for the fact that you, Mrs Diamantopoulou and you, Mrs Péry are here, and I am very much looking forward to hearing your point of view on all the amendments.
Commissioner, we waited with a great deal of anticipation for the Commission' s communication on the strategy which it intends to apply to gender equality over the next five years.
Unfortunately, the time available to u in committee did not give u a chance to process either the communication or Mrs Eriksson' s report although, having said that, we did make every possible effort to respond to the objective set by the European Commission.
We do, of course, agree with the Commission' s justification of the need to integrate the question of equality into all aspect of European policy a well a adopting special measures. We also trust - and here we agree with the rapporteur - that the Commission will present a detailed budget for the programme, especially a regard the allocation of fund between the five high-priority areas.
At the same time, we must stress the need for complementarity between the measure and main line of approach in the area of economic life, equal participation and representation, social rights, the civil society and the role and stereotype of the two sexes.
We trust that the programme will be open to all of society, that knowledge of it will spread far and wide, especially in women' s organisations, that it will provide an opportunity for dialogue and for raising awareness in all the decision-making centre in all the Member States and that numerous agency will have the chance to make good use of it.
Women will then feel close to Europe and Europe will benefit from the interesting and innovative idea which will be formulated a a result of their connection with this programme.
We think it is extremely important to promote a positive image of woman and visibility of their work and importance.
We think that these project will help woman gain self-confidence in their role.
Finally, we trust, a wa said during the previous plenary when we debated older parliamentary reports, that we will have an evaluation procedure of substance and consistency.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have had the fourth framework programme, and today we are discussing the fifth.
The present report by the Commission and Parliament show that despite the fact that there have been a number of success over the past few years, the list of unfinished or unsatisfactory point is too long.
Therefore it is still our goal for the next five year to consolidate the position of woman in the policy of all Member States, both in term of quality and content.
We need measure to be given substance, we require strategic goal and the implementation of policy such a equal opportunity in the economic and social spheres, social right for women, taking into account their personal situations, and the need for childcare. Other point to be considered include the fact that woman might want to take up a career later in life, or resume a career etc., gender roles, stereotypes, and the need for equal participation and representation.
As far a the strategic goal are concerned, for example, in the sphere of 'women in working life' , economic and employment policy issue cannot be dealt with separately from issue of social responsibility, social security, and a fair distribution of caring responsibilities.
Problems to do with access to social security must be looked at on a case-by-case basis to this end.
Furthermore, the Community must do more in the way of assessing the need for additional initiatives, including, where necessary, implementing legislation and equal opportunities, and fighting discrimination.
The European Parliament, the national parliament and network must therefore become more closely involved.
Financial resource are indispensable, a is always the case when goal are to be achieved and there is a great deal of catching up to do.
This programme is therefore conditional on fund totalling EUR 50 million being made available for the period from 2001 to 2005.
This mean that we must step up our effort to achieve a women' s policy that cross the institutional and political divide, and to enable the equal opportunity strategy called for to be implemented more effectively.
We must invest our energy in the realisation and implementation of the planned programmes, and this must go hand in hand with well-timed evaluation and coordination with other programmes.
We expect to receive an annual report from the President of the Commission, within the context of an annual debate in the European Parliament.
It is also necessary to establish a Council of Ministers both in order to deal with the content of the work, and with a view to winning recognition for women' s policy.
Making women' s policy an adjunct to other political theme doe not do the matter justice.
Women' s policy must also be a criterion used to ass whether the candidate country are ready for accession.
The European Parliament could lead the way here by setting a better example.
I hope that the sixth framework programme will not need to be a comprehensive a the present one.
For this to be the case, women' s policy will have to be taken more seriously over the next five year and not just included in all political, economic and social programmes, but actually implemented.
Women' s policy is not - a happens so often - to be incorporated into programme for minorities.
At 52%, woman are not a minority group!
I would like to congratulate Mrs Eriksson on an excellent report and the Commission on an excellent strategy for gender equality.
It encompasses all those area where action is needed and, if successfully coordinated, could make a real difference to woman in all aspect of their everyday lives.
This could work if the framework strategy were an integral part of the programme, a an annex to it.
This would ensure the implementation of the programme and I therefore support the comment made by the rapporteur earlier on.
There ha not been a shortage of good idea or good plan to achieve equality in the past but their implementation ha often failed.
This time the Commission is putting forward a new approach.
It is very welcome but it is only valuable if it can actually be made to work.
That mean also reaching woman in their own communities.
The involvement of local and regional authority in this process is invaluable.
They are the largest employer across the Member States and the central provider of education, training and economic development and, a such, they are key player in achieving equality.
I hope due regard will be paid to them in the final programme.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, no one is disputing that we should strive for greater equity between men and women.
For too long, women' s role ha been despised.
In this respect, the Napoleonic Code, which wa framed in France at the beginning of the 19th century and exported to every corner of Europe, must shoulder a large share of the blame.
Women must once again be given a place that is in keeping with the vital importance of their vocation, and I am not entirely sure that Mrs Eriksson' s report make any contribution towards this.
All the same, the text before u are not entirely lacking in quality.
So, Amendment No 2, presented by my own committee, grant single father the same right a single mothers. Equality and fair treatment must work both ways, that is the ideal.
I am delighted, moreover, that improvement in childcare facility are planned in order to better support the reconciliation of professional and family life.
This report does, however, give some cause for concern.
Amendment No 18, for example, which seek to support action by candidate country to combat discrimination must not afford any opportunity to foist on them social choice alien to their culture.
In this respect, in New York, very distinct difference between the European Union and Poland emerged.
By failing to respect Poland' s social choices, the European Union would be taking a very peculiar, and very disturbing, view of pluralism.
Furthermore, Amendment No 19 on establishing an audit of equal opportunity within the public budget is extremely debatable.
Indeed, the way the concept of discrimination ha been manipulated make it, in many respects, an empty formula used by a whole collection of sorcerer' s apprentice in order to achieve their ideological ends.
It is high time we broke with an ideological vision of woman' s place in society.
In this area, a in many others, it is essential for public authority to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates.
It is not right for a handful of women, expert in making claim of society and living on intravenous injection of public monies, to monopolise the role of speaking on behalf of women.
In this respect, I cannot but endorse the decision by the Committee on Budgets to break the monopoly held for so long by the European Women' s Lobby.
I should like to see this House confirming this bold change of course.
A decision of this type would be like a breath of fresh air to the strange alliance which too closely bind a number of pressure group to the European Commission and to some political group in this House.
The women' s movement can only be strengthened by such a decision.
I could go even further, and say it would be ennobled by such a decision.
This is something my Group will take into consideration in it final vote.
(Applause from the UEN Group)
Mr President, we are aware of the progress that ha been made in recent year with regard to the situation of women, particularly the legislative progress, but there are still situation of real inequality in everyday life.
The low level of representation of woman in political and economic sphere and gender-related violence are two clear sign that structural discrimination against woman is continuing.
This programme will undoubtedly help to ensure that the concerns, need and aspiration of woman are taken into account in all policies.
The current situation requires that positive action measure in favour of woman be implemented.
The objective that the programme set out in five specific area will help to ensure that all the action taken will be associated with at least one of those areas.
Participation in economic life, which woman should enjoy under equal condition to men, employment, which is the basis for all equality and integration, and achieving the 60% target proposed at the Lisbon Summit, would also solve other problems.
The inclusion of this objective in all Community programmes, within the framework of the Structural Funds, should be effected in accordance with Community legislation.
Equality in participation and representation, balance in the decision-making process, greater participation in political life, whatever the process adopted, in order to achieve an increase in the participation of women, until we reach the 40% figure proposed by the Commission.
Equal access and full enjoyment of social right for woman and men, which would mean ensuring that the legislation is applied in the social sphere in term of maternity leave, maternity protection, working time, employment contracts, etc.
Equality between woman and men in civil life, allowing woman to fully enjoy human right and fundamental freedoms.
We especially need to guard against and eradicate trafficking in woman and domestic violence.
We need to encourage a change in the role and stereotype associated with gender, which will also help to solve some of the other problem above.
In relation to this objective we will support the organisation of awareness campaign and a European Equality Week in cooperation with the Member States, a the Commission proposes.
We think that it is very useful to create a web site, not only due to the increasing use of computerised media, but because this will help woman to familiarise themselves more and more with this new world from which they must not be excluded.
Something that we think is of particular importance is the evaluation of the programme ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, I believe we are now discussing Commissioner Diamantopoulou' s second tour de force.
With the framework strategy and the new action programme in place, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities - working under intense time pressure, and restricted to only a few official language - ha now, with a great deal of good will, introduced 60 proposed amendments.
I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council, Nicole Péry, will be able to get through the programme in the Council in November.
I hope there will be no repeat of the fourth action programme, when the erstwhile Federal Government under Helmut Kohl halved the budget, no less.
Time is pressing.
Women are still not adequately represented in politics and in economic decision-making processes.
According to EUROSTAT, approximately 77% of the recipient of low wage are women.
Depending on the country and sector, woman earn up to 30% le than their male counterparts.
The framework strategy must be brought to bear in this regard a well.
All the equal opportunity initiative should be coordinated under one roof and translated into the five, specific, strategic goals.
Other speaker have made the same point.
That would be the logical way to implement the gender mainstreaming concept.
I am expecting the male protagonist to at last get down to work and do their bit to counter inherited notion of gender role and stereotypes.
We also want to see the leading politician on our side, and call upon President Prodi, the Council, and the Ministers, to take full account of the gender aspect, for example in the context of the European Union' s foreign relations, and particularly where the enlargement process is concerned.
More emphasis should be placed on establishing link between women' s organisations, which is something I called for back when I wa rapporteur for the interim report on the fourth action programme.
Our parliamentary committee plan to stage a conference on this specialist policy area, together with the parliamentary committee of our Member States and of the candidate countries, in November in Berlin.
I am hoping that this will provide the necessary political impetus for the implementation of the programme and framework strategy.
This is where Europe will again lead the way in the fight for women' s right in Europe.
Mr President, following the first four action programme for equality between woman and men, it wa a good move on the part of the Commission to innovate by proposing a Community framework strategy for equality and a programme to implement this strategy and make real progress towards equality.
There is great need of this, even though a quarter of a century ha passed since the first Community directive on the equal treatment of men and woman with regard to pay.
I find the Commission' s new approach to be a very positive one, and the proposal for a decision for the 2001-2005 programme to have been well considered.
Unfortunately, the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is no improvement on the text put forward by the Commission.
It overeggs the pudding, and includes unconsidered and indigestible proposals, worded in such a way a to make a first-year law student' s hair stand on end.
In committee, I had tabled a raft of amendment intended to do away with the worst of the incongruities, particularly those that demonstrated an outlandish mish-mash of strategy and programmes.
The Commission ha produced an excellent text.
It is a very serious mistake, in politics, to mix strategy up with tactic or with programmes.
As is so often the case in report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, we have here a report including the ideological claim of the left wing coalition, the gauche plurielle, in this Parliament, like the claim that measure eligible for programme funding in a transnational context should include the analysis and assessment of, I quote, "the significance of a general reduction in working hours" .
Do we really need to waste any of the paltry EUR 53.45 million in appropriation to cover five year on such an analysis?
I think not.
I am also of the opinion that the appropriation for the European Women' s Lobby, budget line A 3037, should not be included in the appropriation committed for the programme and I hope that the Commissioner will favour the amendment that I and the other member of my Group have tabled, above the rapporteur' s own far-fetched amendments.
Mr President, I think it would be a great shame if Nicole Péry were not also to seize the opportunity to state her opinion now that she is here, so that we might hear her point of view, too.
Mrs Eriksson, Mrs Péry ha not asked to speak and I cannot force her to. I cannot order the President-in-Office of the Council to take the floor.
In any case, I feel that we should thank her for following the debate, especially since she wa not scheduled to be present during this discussion a well.
However, I see that she is preparing to leave now.
Mr President, I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Eriksson, who ha endeavoured in the short time available to respond to the need for u to accept the programme a quickly a possible, so that we can avoid a vacuum between the fourth and fifth programme and can start implementing the fifth programme in January.
This programme is an important document for the Committee on Women' s Rights, which is why it provoked a great deal of interest and, of course, it form part of the more overall strategy which wa discussed with the Committee on Women' s Rights, the Committee on Social Affairs and the Council.
It is the familiar 5-pronged strategy of participation of woman in economic life, at the decision-making centres, in social policy, in civil society and in human rights, together with the new model of gender equality for the mass medium and education.
Our cooperation with the committee wa excellent, which is why we can accept a large number of amendments, either to the letter or in spirit.
Specifically, we accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 28, 32, 43, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55, 56 and 59.
We are also able to accept part of Amendments Nos 3, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 20, 27, 35, 37, 45, 50, 53, 57 and 58.
I think that the large number of amendment accepted is illustrative of the meeting of mind between the Commission and the Committee on Women' s Rights.
I should like to make two comment on the amendment which we are unable to accept, mainly for technical and legal reason rather than because of a difference of approach.
First, a far a the strategy is concerned.
It is not possible for the entire strategy to form part of the Council decision, but I agree that some amendment could be made to the wording of the article in order to make it perfectly clear that this strategy ha been taken into account and form the basis on which the programme will be implemented.
Secondly, a far a the specific percentage to be earmarked from the Structural Funds is concerned.
I should remind you that a regulation wa voted through last year which clearly set out how item are allocated and we cannot use a programme to change the regulation which already exists.
I must stress that we absolutely agree on the need to focus on complementarity between current action and programme and, of course, on the important role which non-governmental organisation must play in designing and implementing these programmes.
And I should like to stress, in the light of certain comments, that the women' s lobby really doe play an important coordinating role at European level and that there are no protest or complaint in the Commission about exempting certain organisations; on the contrary, European organisation a a whole are able to take part in all the programmes, such a this programme, EQUAL, the programme to combat discrimination, the programme to combat exclusion, DAPHNE or STOP.
Major European women' s organisation therefore clearly have access to all the programmes.
I really do believe that the strategy behind this programme, the main objective of which is to implement mainstreaming in all policies, is a huge challenge for all of us, both at Commission level, with the cooperation between the individual committee which we need in order to obtain a final result, and at national level, with the need for horizontal action in every ministry so that the women' s policy becomes a horizontal policy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Competition policy
The next item is the joint debate on the two report tabled on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy:
(A5-0290/2000) tabled by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on the XXIXth report on competition policy - 1999 [SEC(2000) 720 - C5-0302/2000 - 2000/2153 (COS)];
(A5-0281/2000) tabled by Mr Evans, on the Commission's eighth survey on State aid in the European Union [COM(2000) 205 - C5-0430/2000 - 2000/2211(COS)].
Mr President, I very much welcome the Commission' s report.
It is a splendid piece of work that Commissioner Monti and his staff carried out last year.
In my report on the twenty-ninth report on the Commission' s competition policy, I expended particular energy on the problem concerning merger and the repayment of State aid.
I did this for a number of reasons.
Firstly because, in the course of last year, I wa approached on a number of occasion by company which have felt a certain degree of powerlessness in connection with ruling on mergers, especially in relation to those case in which they have needed to appeal to the Court of First Instance against the Commission' s ruling.
With regard to State aid, moreover, problem apparently still exist with ensuring that unlawfully paid State aid is paid back to the national exchequers.
Let u begin, however, with mergers. One consequence of EMU is, of course, that we see more and more mergers.
I also think the time is ripe for re-assessing whether the procedure and set of rule we have at present are a good a they could be.
The world is not, of course, always so easy for those who have to follow the rule and procedure we are involved in devising.
I think it is necessary for clear rule to be devised for what is called the relevant market.
It is important to distinguish between what may be called the peripheral area of Europe and what may be called the heart of Europe.
It is especially important to put this distinction in place before enlargement, for it can be difficult for the smaller country in the peripheral area when company wish to merge, because the latter quickly become large player in their own market.
It is not especially appropriate that larger company in small country should be prevented from merging for, in that way, their opportunity to compete globally are reduced.
I should therefore like to remind you that we do, of course, have existing rule to take care of those circumstance in which company exploit their important and possibly dominant market positions.
We therefore need not perhaps be so afraid of mergers.
After all, it is not a crime for company to merge.
Another thing I feel very strongly about is the need to arrange for merger to go through more quickly.
I am thinking here, in particular, of those circumstance in which a company wish to appeal against the Commission' s ruling.
Quite simply, a period of between 25 and 35 month is too long in our global village for getting a case through the courts, and what is very time consuming is having the document of the case translated.
That is not good enough.
We owe it to our company to offer them the best condition so that they are able to plan their production and, especially, their future.
On the subject of mergers, I have two question for you, Commissioner Monti.
Would it be possible to consider different possible solution for separating the Commission' s function of judge and prosecutor?
For example, could there be a panel of independent expert during the second hearing so that it is not exclusively people from the Commission who ass individual merger cases?
I also have another idea, even if it is perhaps a touch outside your sphere of authority.
Might not a committee of expert or an expert tribunal, specialising in companies, be set up in the department of first instance at the court in Luxembourg?
In Denmark, for example, we have a special maritime and commercial court dealing exclusively with issue relating to companies.
I would also take the opportunity of asking the Commissioner to explain why one of the most trusted merger specialist ha left the Commission.
The other subject I raised in my report is that of State aid and the repayment of State aid which ha been awarded unlawfully.
I make no secret of the fact that I feel very strongly about tightening up on the repayment of State aid which ha been awarded unlawfully, especially since this is another area it is important to sort out before enlargement.
It is good that State aid to shipyard in Europe should be phased out a per 1 January 2001, even if it is extremely problematic that our shipyard should continue to have to compete with the South Korean treasury.
In the light of the latest development, I can appreciate why the Commission has, with good reason, adopted a harder line on South Korea.
I am wondering, therefore, if you could report on the very latest developments, Commissioner, even though I am well aware that you only have limited time available.
I also want to take the opportunity to ask Commissioner Monti if and when a public, efficient and properly functioning register of State aid may be expected to be put in place and, in the same vein, when the long-promised scoreboard is to become a reality.
Finally, I want to emphasise that, for me a a liberal, it is crucially important that company can be sure of being dealt with properly and efficiently in all areas, so that there are no hitch where companies' future legal certainty is concerned.
I should also like to thank my fellow MEPs in Committee for the splendid way in which they have cooperated in connection with my report.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her contribution and for her cooperation in relation to these two reports.
They have been taken in joint debate because common issue apply.
I endorse much of the agenda that ha been set by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen.
I should like to begin somewhat unusually by congratulating the Commission on a document it published back in June 1999 - the Community rule on state aid, what I might call the "idiot's guide" to the operation of the state aid scheme.
It is helpful in that it set out the Treaty provisions, the definition of state aid and also the exemption from the ban on state aid.
In the course of preparing my report, I have had to struggle with that particular conundrum.
There are those in this House who will wish to emphasise the exemptions; however, I wish to make it clear that for the most part the operation of state aid work against free competition within a single market.
The single market is essential in term of promoting the interest of consumers.
They must have a wide variety of high-quality, competitively priced good and that, ultimately, is the reason for pushing forward with the single market and, along with it, free competition, because it is to the benefit of all our citizens.
Turning now to the eighth survey: although there ha been a reduction in the overall level of state aid during the period concerned, this can in fact be attributed to a minority of Member States and, taken overall, ten Member States have seen level of state aid increase.
I know that is a matter of concern to the Commissioner and it is certainly a concern I share.
I therefore welcome the indication we have received from the Commissioner that he anticipates that by July of next year we will be seeing progress in relation to the delivery of a state aid scoreboard and register.
That is important in term of the need for transparency.
I would ask him how he see the debate on enlargement in view of the fact that, on the one hand, we must ensure that we have a common regime across all state within the European Union and, on the other hand, it must be the case that some of the candidate country have particular difficulty in adjusting to new open market conditions.
I would also make the point to Commissioner Monti that it is important that in the next survey we see a rather larger section on the financial service sector.
I should like to congratulate him on a speech he made in Barcelona in September - and I am very grateful to his staff for sending a copy of the speech to me - devoted a it wa to his view on the synergy between state aid control and the financial service sector.
But in due course we must see rather more of that in the state aid report itself.
I also would wish to see change in the way that the state aid report is put together in order to ensure it is able to take account of future developments.
For instance, during the period of time of this report, no state aid wa given to the coal sector in the UK and yet we all know that significant aid is currently being proposed by the UK Government.
I should like to say in that context that I am very strongly of the view, a is the steel industry in very many part of the European Union, that the steel aid code, which it is not planned to extend beyond 2002, need to remain in place in order that all business are aware, in the current difficult circumstance for the steel industry, that a strict regime will be applied within the European Union, which is not discriminatory a between one country and another.
I take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner for some information regarding two case within the United Kingdom where the Commission ha currently instituted action - if indeed it is the case that action ha been instituted.
There are the case of the universal bank proposed by the UK Government to assist post office in the UK and also the venture capital scheme in the region of the United Kingdom.
I understand he ha asked for information concerning this.
It is quite clear that throughout the report itself much attention ha been directed not just to the past but also to Commissioner Monti' s proposal for future reform of competition policy.
That is an issue which will be coming before Parliament in due course.
Commissioner Monti will be very well aware of the concern that are shared by many people who support his proposal for reform but feel that there need to be answer in relation to issue like jurisdiction shopping, legal certainty, the role of national courts, dialogue between the national competition authority and the Commission itself, a also issue of staffing within the Commission.
Those are matter that we will consider in debate in due course and for which - I am delighted to inform the Commission - I have been appointed Parliament' s rapporteur.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, in view of the lavish amount of speaking time we permit ourselves for debate of this kind, I want to dispense with the preliminary and address Commissioner Monti directly.
Commissioner, you know that for some time now, there ha been a substantial consensus in this House on competition issues. This mean that the entire House support the Commission in matter of competition policy.
With the passage of time though, I have begun to wonder whether the Commission is not, in fact, gradually losing it sense of perspective where individual decision are concerned, or whether it even want to prejudge fundamental decision in entirely different political field under the mantle of competition.
I will cite one of several examples, and it is one that is currently the subject of intense debate in other region besides my own.
It concern the subsidisation decision or non-subsidisation decision in relation to the coal industry.
I will take the precaution, Commissioner - in case you should want to point out that this in fact fall within Commissioner Palacio' s remit - of saying that I am addressing the Commission a a whole.
I would also draw your attention to the fact that the coal issue is raised both in the competition report and in the subsidy report that we are discussing today.
I expect the Commission to uphold it agreements.
I do not expect it to abuse judgement from the Court of Justice in order to withdraw from these agreements.
I will reiterate what I have already said repeatedly in debate of this kind: competition is not an end in itself.
When a decision is to be taken in matter of competition policy, account must be taken of the social, structural and industrial implications, and if this is not done then competition policy will degenerate to the level of pure ideology.
If the aspect I mentioned are taken into consideration, and one considers the net product chain of the state-of-the-art technology, then the subsidy licence that have fallen due for coal mining must be granted without delay.
This doe not just apply to the sphere of energy policy; it applies right across the board.
Competition is important but it is not the be-all and end-all.
To sum up, what we need is to strike a balance between competition rule and acting for the public good.
This must be the guiding principle in all areas.
Commissioner, I want to take up what I said at the beginning.
The support is still there.
But if you carry on in this vein, you risk losing the support of not insignificant section of the House.
I dare say that is unlikely to help matter overall.
Mr President, I am going to talk about Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report.
I want to begin by congratulating her on a very good report.
One of the absolutely basic principle of EU cooperation is that competition between different companies, products, country and region should work well and be fair and correct, a well a be for the benefit of consumers.
Allow me to begin with something said by Adam Smith, the father of economic liberalism, in 1776, to the effect that people in the same industry seldom meet for pleasure or diversion without their conversations' ending with a conspiracy against the general public or some device for raising prices.
Certainly, a good deal ha happened in the last 200 year or so, but we have the same aspiration today.
If the internal market is to operate, we must have active institution which look after issue of competition.
Commissioner Monti is to be congratulated in this respect.
Paragraph 16 of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report talk of increased legal certainty where application for merger are concerned, together with more effective and shorter timeframes within which to appeal before courts.
This applies particularly in view of the fact that, in dealing with mergers, the Commission ha something of a double role.
The Commission both supervises and applies the rule of competition.
This double role make special demand in term of openness, control and predictability.
The second paragraph I want to mention is paragraph 18.
It is of general relevance, but it point of departure is the planned merger between motor manufacturer Volvo and Scania.
As is well known, the Commission opposed this merger, which in turn led to an extensive debate about how the rule of competition operate and how market share are to be calculated and assessed.
A clearer definition and further discussion are needed in this area.
As long a the internal market is not complete, it is mainly large company in small Member States which can lose out in competitiveness to company elsewhere in the world.
How are large company with large home market to be able to merge and compete in a global market if the EU' s rule make this impossible?
Coming a I do from a small country, I myself am very pleased, therefore, that the Committee should have adopted the amendment I proposed in this connection.
I hope that the Commission is now also prepared to broaden the discussion and shed more light on the rule of competition on the basis of these assumptions.
Commissioner Monti, on behalf of the Italian Radicals, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the two sound report they have produced, which commend both your work and the work of the Directorate-General for Competition.
I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few general point regarding European competition policy and also the competitiveness and opening-up of the European markets, not in order to deny any progress made thusfar, but with a view to the future.
In my opinion, a particularly regrettable factor, if we want a genuinely open and competitive market economy to develop, is still the presence of large number of powerful public company in sector which have already been formally liberalised or which are currently going through this process.
I could mention, for example ... let me see ... the State monopoly of retirement pensions, but I will restrict myself, more pertinently, to firm operating in the sector of general interest services.
It is my view that, in these sectors, competition and the market are being severely hampered by the fact that the State is both regulator and operator.
I know, Commissioner, because I have had occasion to read and hear your view on the matter, that your response to the objection is that the article of the Treaties do not provide for any distinction between the public or private nature of firms.
However, we cannot be satisfied with this response if we want Europe to become a more competitive and more open market in the future and - dare I say it - if we study carefully certain situation which are developing, in which even the current rule would allow u to intervene.
The whole of Europe is experiencing the growth of an aggressive State capitalism which ha resulted in a series of private company being taken over by State monopoly or former monopolies, in any case by company which are firmly in public hands, company which are State-owned.
We have heard the justification many times; it is always ready to be trotted out - we must ensure that our company and their asset retain their value through the privatisation process - meanwhile privatisation generally becomes more and more delayed instead of facilitated.
And, naturally, these are clearly statement to which the ear of the various Ministers for the Treasury in Europe are extremely sensitive.
In all cases, these are public company whose financial prowess derives from their past and present position of monopoly rather than managerial expertise.
In many cases, they are company which operate entirely or in part with considerable legal monopolistic reserves.
Truly, Commissioner, can we not perceive in these case the existence of State aid, concealed to a greater or lesser extent, or abuse of a dominating position?
Or again, the transfer at the very least of the distorting effect of the dominating position from one sector to another?
Or, lastly, the ever increasing consolidation of the position of the incumbent which will make it difficult for newcomer to enter the various market after liberalisation?
By way of example, Deutsche Post ha recently gained control of DHL International and is operating under a monopoly for dispatch up to 200 grams, and then, on a more general note, we could cite the diversification of the State postal company in other sectors;
EDF (Eléctricité de France) ha taken over company in Britain, Sweden and Finland, France Telecom ha taken over Orange; on the Italian side of things, Enel ha taken over Infostrada and, still in the Italian context, we could mention the various company owned by local authority which are behaving in a similar fashion.
Lastly, Commissioner, there is the case of the public financing of State television under the alibi of financing a public service, which is a concept that is fading fast.
Of course, there is the Treaty of Amsterdam, but I wonder whether the constraint imposed by the government on the excellent work of your predecessor should, in any case, be justified a a way of exempting these company from European competition rules.
Mr President, we welcome the modernisation of the competition policy which, in term of set-up, ha undergone little change since the sixties.
This overhaul is all the more imperative since nearly all of the Member States have now established a sound, independent competition authority.
I do not share the concern expressed by quite a few fellow MEPs with regard to the re-nationalisation of policy.
If we want to avoid a chaotic and unwieldy bureaucracy in Brussels, then we have no choice but to embrace decentralisation.
I am delighted about the special attention being paid to the position of large undertaking in small Member States in Paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution.
These are the one experiencing major adverse effect from infringement of the internal market or from the continued existence of border within the internal market, because their 'home market' cannot sufficiently absorb these blows.
What are the Commissioner' s objection to lending the concept of 'relevant market' a predominantly EU-wide dimension in the event of mergers?
I would also like to draw the Commissioner' s attention to the environmental significance of soil decontamination projects.
Naturally, we endorse the polluter pay principle. But this principle certainly cannot always be applied, especially in the case of large or substantial soil decontamination projects, because we will then end up with contaminated soil well into the next century.
Given the staff shortage in your Directorate-General, Mr Monti, it is not logical to accord a great deal of attention to this.
It seems to me that the effect of these project on the competitive sphere is rather minor.
Finally, the book by your predecessor, and former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, entitled "Mijn jaren in Europa" [My year in Europe] give some idea of the blackmail-like tactic which a Competition Commissioner come up against.
It speaks volumes.
I hope you are affected by this to a lesser extent, but I fear the worst.
I therefore wish you all the strength and wisdom you will need to keep your chin up over the next couple of years, and I look forward to reading similar memoir by yourself in due course.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, first of all I would like to say a warm thank you for the report we have heard about today, and which do not just record what happened in the past, but also pick out the central theme of the present debate, and even incorporate the Commission' s plans.
Competition is not, a ha already been said, an end in itself.
It must serve the interest of consumers, company and local conditions.
Competition is therefore always a mean to an end.
It is a vital cornerstone of our model, in term of political order, of the socio-economic market economy.
I stress this point because the market cannot regulate everything, which is why competition is not completely unrestricted, nor should it be.
We therefore need two things: firstly, in the interest of increased transparency, we need to make the public aware of all the approved subsidy that influence competition, and secondly there must be area of our day-to-day life and behaviour which are not subject lock, stock and barrel to the dictate of European competition policy.
The sport sphere or the numerous non-governmental organisation in the social and health spheres, to quote two examples.
Who, like us, say 'yes' to a functioning internal market, must also have the courage of their conviction to say 'yes' to European competition policy.
Therefore, we welcome the modernisation of competition policy, which is initiated and then maintained by a stream of new proposals.
The Community' s competition policy ha been given a new European and international dimension.
In view of the enlargement process and globalisation, it is playing an increasingly important part in economic relation within and outside the European Union.
I therefore welcome the modernisation going on within the Community on the one hand, and the fact that European competition policy now extends beyond Union borders.
On a final note, we need a more precise definition of the relevant market because, increasingly, the market is not the national market.
We need to promote the citizens' awareness of competition policy, so that they recognise the advantages.
We also need to step up debate in the European public arena on the relevant proposals, because they are frequently misunderstood.
What I mean - and this is directed at the public, not the Commission - is that it decentralised application must not lead to renationalisation, but must instead lead to Europeanisation.
When you delegate responsibility, you must take care not to surrender your key responsibility!
Lastly, boosting the citizens' autonomy must not create legal uncertainty, rather, European competition policy must well and truly leave it mark on the thought and action of the people beyond the institutions.
We still have a lot to do on that score, Commissioner!
Mr President, today no one disputes, and of course I am not going to do so, the fact that state aid alters the condition for competition and is a damaging element that encourages inefficiency in undertakings.
This is certain, but if each and every one of u is honest, we have to admit that in our public life we have often defended state aid when an undertaking ha required it in order to establish itself, for example, in our constituency, or in order to prevent it from closing.
I began by saying this in order to highlight what is associated with some position and to point out that when we are trying to issue a European Parliament opinion on the annual report on state aid, the Group of the Europe People' s Party try to conduct an ideological debate in this House on state aid in which it aim to go further than anyone and to demonise all type of aid.
This happened last year with the Jonckheer report, and this year, despite the more flexible position adopted by Mr Evans, it ha continued to arise, perhaps in order to present the Socialists a some sort of outdated interventionists who use measure that are a damaging for the market a state aid.
I have already had the opportunity to express that state aid is a transfer of public money to private company and, therefore, that a Socialists we should also be against it.
However, we cannot deny the obvious and we should recall that the Treaty doe not forbid all type of aid, so some type that are aimed at objective such a social cohesion, regional cohesion, the environment, etc. should be permitted. If that is the case, and it is, why doe the Group of the Europe People' s Party refuse to accept amendment that cover that point?
The same occurs when the report insists, following the Commission' s line, that aid for coal did not serve to secure the future of the industry, but in the same paragraph they refuse to accept a sentence, also from the Commission, saying that this aid wa necessary in order to mitigate the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the sector.
In this respect, it is difficult for u to agree with a report which, although it reflects part of the truth, refuse to include another part of the truth.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Evans and Mr Karas have highlighted the significance of state aid and competition policy very clearly in this debate.
In future we must remember that there are national aid schemes, in respect of internal competition, for example, which are especially important and valuable in country with low population density and where distance are long.
I wish to raise one issue in this regard, that of transport aid.
I am thinking here of my own country, for example, where the distance are long.
In the north the price of fuel is 0.2 euro higher than in southern Finland.
In addition, shipment of raw materials, animal feedingstuffs and similar good are especially important a far a internal competition is concerned and issue of major importance in order that state aid may continue to support them.
They are especially significant with regard to the regional economy and employment, and I hope that in future this can be made clear, so that these aids, these internal aids, which affect regional development and the regional economy, in which transport aid is a key example, might continue.
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, lady and gentlemen, a European, open, competitive and coordinated market economy need an effective competition policy.
Without a properly administered competition policy, neither the European Union' s economy nor it external manifestation, in the form of the euro, will ever be able to achieve it full potential.
Only a company that is competitive in the Internal Market without State aid can also be competitive in the global market.
However, in shaping European competition policy we have to ensure that it doe not limit the opportunity for company to succeed in the wider, global economy a well.
As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen quite rightly emphasis in her report and speech, there is a danger, particularly with regard to the small Member States, that too narrow a concept of the market is used to define a dominant market position, which make it harder for company in small Member States to become sufficiently large player in the area of global competition.
Besides, a dominant market position is not even a problem unless there is evidence that this position is being abused.
Only if the dominant market position lead to adversity with regard to consumer and competitor must we tackle the situation using stringent measures, a you, Mr Monti, have done.
As Mrs Riis-Jørgensen state in point 15 of her report, we have to focus on the harm caused a a result of measure restricting competition, and not so much on what sort of economic player are involved.
Special account must be taken of the position of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Small-scale State aid might be more harmful to an SME than people think if the market is a small one.
For that reason it is good that this report of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s also emphasis the importance of this.
In his report, my colleague, Mr Evans, thanks you, Mr Monti, for having got to grip with the issue of State aid policy.
Massive amount of State aid are still a problem in many sectors.
Although State aid may, on the surface, seem a good solution, when viewed in the longer term it very rarely produce lasting positive results.
I certainly do not want to condemn all State aid.
There is also aid that is necessary, a laid down the Treaties.
In the long run, however, level of State aid will have to fall.
State aid lead to the postponement of inevitable structural change, to the distortion of competition, and breed inefficiency.
In a sense, State aid prop up Potemkin villages, which at some stage will come crashing down.
Then it is the private consumer and the taxpayer who foot the bill.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, first of all let me express my deep disagreement with the excessively liberal, if not actually ultraliberal, tendency of the report by our fellow Member, Mr Evans.
Hearing him deny the fact that state aid wa reduced in the period 1994-1998, even though the Commission itself acknowledges this reduction, is already bizarre, to say the least.
It is all the more serious, however, to see him, in an almost obsessive way, stressing the exceptional nature of state aid, even though the Treaty itself provides for the use of such aid in order to achieve the objective set by the Treaties, such a in matter of the environment or social cohesion, and even though the European Commission itself recognises that some policy cannot be sustained solely by market forces. These, I feel, are adequate reason for me not to support the report a it stands.
And, even if I can relate to the demand for increased transparency on the subject of state aid, and for Parliament to be kept informed with regard to the monitoring of aid approved by the Commission, I shall nonetheless continue to argue in favour of maintaining state aid in order to develop social cohesion, research, innovation, environmental protection, in order to compensate for shortfall in the market, in order to promote European competitiveness in the world, in order to combat the fraudulent machination of competing countries, such a Korea in the sphere of shipbuilding.
Let me add that state aid must be supervised strictly according to the term of the treaty and not in accordance with the prevailing liberal ideology.
Between the omnipresent State, which no one want any more, and the completely absent State, which is nothing more than a modern-day law of the jungle, this concept which many term the European social model force u to continually seek a balance between those thing that can be governed by the market and those which public authority have a duty to regulate.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, we are also to discus the Montfort report this week, which Parliament want to use to promote an entrepreneurial way of thinking.
It is therefore particularly apt to acknowledge three thing in this debate.
Firstly, the fact that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights ha now been drafted, Article 16 of which establishes the right to entrepreneurial freedom.
Of course, this right demand strict competition law, because only this will guarantee fair competition.
It protects consumer and investors.
Secondly, it is only right that we should acknowledge the highly commendable book by Karel van Miert, which tell u about the mean employed by entrepreneur to bring pressure to bear on other entrepreneurs.
Thirdly therefore, I would like to congratulate the Commission and it staff on the action and decision they have taken in the field of competition law, previously under Karel van Miert and now under your overall control, Professor Monti.
Against this background, you have reworked a communication on service of general interest and set out the legal situation once again.
This statement contains three important messages.
Firstly, the Member States have the right to define everything that belongs under this heading.
Secondly, the Member States have the right to inject supplementary funding if it would otherwise be impossible to maintain these activities.
And thirdly - and this is highly relevant to this debate - there must of course be no area which are exempt from competition law.
It is therefore possible to see why renationalisation would spell trouble.
It must not annul the general validity of Community law.
Hence those article in the motion for resolution which point to this fact, including the need for transparency, are particularly valuable.
Professor Monti, I would like to make a suggestion in this respect. You really ought to clarify, at an earlier stage, that start-up aid - the administration of which varies substantially from Member State to Member State, in the sphere of renewable energy for example - will enjoy confidentiality protection, at least for the duration of it lifetime, even if, in the meantime - which is what I am hoping will happen - the Union a a whole upgrade it support measures.
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
(ES) Mr President, I would first like to apologise for having arrived late.
Secondly, I would like to welcome the work done by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, with whom I have had an excellent and constructive relationship.
And obviously, Mr President, although my opinion refers to the Commission' s 29th report on competition policy, it is inevitable at such a time that we will look to the past, but for no other reason than in order to learn for the future.
It ha been said - and I am only going to pick up on what ha been said so far - that competition is presently the big word in our society, it is the great catalyst for the development of our society, particularly of our European society.
In short, we see that industry entered into competition following the Treaty of Rome, that this competition wa also extended to service on the basis of the single market and that, with the euro, it extended to financial services. We see that now, driven by international competition and by the new technologies, the large telecommunication sector is being dealt with.
Therefore, Mr President, we need to recognise that, with Member States that are ceasing to be producer and becoming regulators, the Commission policy need to change, and in this sense, this report is part of that important development.
In it opinion, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market did nothing more than highlight something which ha been said and repeated: that we need clear rules, because this is the only way of knowing what the rule of play are.
We cannot leave everything to the market with no regulation at all.
What we need are clear rule and - I stress - rule that are of a sufficient level or category.
In any event, interpretation or interpretative communication are no good.
And also, of course, that the Commission' s policy, which we welcome and support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, should not be shaped, in this process of decentralisation, to the detriment of small and medium-sized businesses, to the detriment of the citizens.
I will end with a phrase from John Rawls, the philosopher of law: inequality are always justified when they increase the level of the system and support the weakest without affecting fundamental rights.
Commissioner, knowing how far this go in the universal service, in public service, is the great challenge for the Commission.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament in general for the great interest that it ha once again displayed in matter of competition.
Mr heartfelt thanks to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her valuable contribution a rapporteur of the XXIXth report on competition policy.
A big thank you to Mr Evans a well, for his excellent report on the rule governing State aid to the steel industry and on the eighth survey on State aid in the European Union.
All three report assume considerable importance in the light of the effort the Commission ha made to increase the transparency of it competition policy and to explain what it is doing to the citizens.
On the subject of explaining competition policy, I would like to say that I am extremely pleased with the success of the first two European Competition Days, which were held in Lisbon on 9 June and in Paris on 17 October this year.
The idea wa conceived in this Parliament and developed by Parliament and the Commission.
My feeling is that, together, we are making progress in helping the citizen to understand this policy.
I would like to stress that I fully agree with much of what ha been said and with very many of the point contained in the resolutions.
Mr President, in the time available to me, I would like to focus on the following three points: the modernisation of Community competition law, the practical application of competition rule in 1999 and State aid.
On the subject of modernisation, I will attempt, within the constraint imposed, to respond to some of the extremely interesting point which have been raised.
The annual report on competition policy emphasis the need to modernise the legislative and interpretative framework of Community competition law in the area of both monopoly and State aid.
I will not go into the detail of the reform project which have recently been completed or are still being developed, for they have already been the subject of a specific consultation process between the Commission and Parliament, or will be in the future, in the constructive dialogue which is so valuable.
With regard to State aid, in my opinion, the entry into force, in 1999, of the Rules of Procedure wa a considerable step forward.
They increase transparency and establish the deadline for adopting the decision on State aid.
As far a monopoly are concerned, the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the matter on 27 September last.
A great many observation made by Parliament during consultation over the White Paper were taken into account even a early a at the stage of drawing up the proposal.
Particular attention wa paid to the concern expressed by Parliament regarding renationalisation and legal certainty.
I would therefore like to assure Mrs Palacio, Mr Karas and the other Members who spoke on these point that the regulation take their concern into ample consideration.
I am now waiting for the commencement of the second stage of dialogue between our two institution on these legislative proposal and I am sure that it will be a constructive a the first stage.
As you know, on 9 and 10 November, the Commission and Parliament are jointly organising a conference on this reform in Freiburg, a conference proposed for the first time precisely in your resolution on the White Paper.
My second point is the application of the competition rule during 1999.
In the year in question, there were an unusually large number of case requiring the use of considerable resource and which were closed by formal decisions.
One of the thing I appreciate is your call for an increase in human resources.
The Commission ha continued to intervene resolutely, particularly where cartel and abuse of a dominating position are concerned.
As in the debate on mergers, since time is limited and I prefer to attempt to answer some of the specific questions, I will not mention the major - albeit numerous - intervention we have made.
The third point is State aid.
I am happy to note the support which Parliament continues to lend u in relation to the eighth survey too.
I welcome Parliament's proposal on the future development of these information tools, which will include the register and the scoreboard a well a audits.
I confirm to Mr Evans and the other Members who have spoken on this subject that we will be ready to present the initial version of the register and the scoreboard - Mrs Riis-Jørgensen also upholds this idea - before June 2001, and I am confident that transparency will be an important additional tool for the application of the legal instrument governing State aid.
Mr President, I would now like to focus on at least some of the specific point raised.
Several Members - Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, Mr Schmidt, Mr Blokland and Mrs Kauppi - have posed the problem of large company operating in relatively small countries.
Could we not relax the definition of the relevant market there, when it come to merger operations?
Well, if the relevant market, on the basis of the analysis conducted, happens to be national in scope, you must realise that doing what you suggest would amount to discrimination against the consumer and customer in those national markets.
What we have to work together for is to gradually establish in the marketplace the reality of a single market going beyond the national market.
Otherwise we would be serving our purpose of helping competition and the consumer in a perverse way.
I add, in relation to the specific Volvo-Scania case that I am sure underlies many speakers' remarks, that both company have been able to reach solution that make their own further international growth compatible with the protection of the interest of competition and consumer in those markets.
Should we introduce a panel of independent expert to ass mergers?
The recourse to external expertise can be useful and already take place in a number of cases.
But the Commission should not and will not give it ultimate responsibility of taking decision to an external body.
It belongs to us.
It may, on occasion, be uncomfortable, but this is our task.
Concerning the problem of one DG Competition official who resigned, I have already expressed my regret about that resignation.
Further increasing the right of defence, the transparency of the procedures, including the enhanced position of the hearing officer, is something to which I am very much attached and upon which I am reflecting, taking into account several input including the useful idea provided by that official before he resigned.
As far a Korea is concerned, Mr Lamy, who will be coming here during the course of the week, will be better placed to update you on the latest developments.
I can only, for my part, state my conviction that any extension of operating state aid to shipyard would not be the appropriate response to a situation that requires other type of intervention.
Mr Evans, I very much share your concern on the issue of state aid to financial services.
We will pursue that point with determination.
Mr Rapkay, it ha been extremely important for the Commission to have the support of the European Parliament in pursuit of it competition policy and I do not feel that this support may fade away.
Looking at the resolution we are discussing today, I see the Commission' s policy a very much in line with a vigorous implementation of those resolutions.
In the area notably of state aids, it must not be thought that the Commission belief in a pure or ultra-liberal policy.
State aid have their place but it is a fact that in many case the concrete manifestation of state aid go well beyond what the Treaty allows and what the guideline allow.
But believe me, I certainly see competition policy a an instrument of a social market economy.
The stronger the implementation of competition the better the market tends to be.
There is full scope for social aspect provided they are not mixed up in a non-transparent way with the functioning of the market.
Mr Della Vedova, the presence of public company raise competition problem and - although it is possible and I have, of course, to confirm that the Treaty provides for neutrality with regard to private or public ownership - it is possible to intervene in the event of distortion: the instrument are those which you mentioned, the instrument on the control of State aid and on the abuse of dominant positions.
You mentioned Deutsche Post: for example, procedure are currently in progress at the Commission on Deutsche Post in respect of both these areas, and I can assure you that the Commission doe not intend the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on public television broadcasting to create a condition preventing appropriate control of State aid on this matter a well.
In this regard, and a far a State aid is concerned, I refer you to the Communication adopted by the Commission on 20 September on service of general economic interest.
Mr President, I think I have exceeded the time allowed to me.
I apologise to those to whose question I have not had time to respond.
I would, however, like to end by quoting the report of the Legal Affairs Committee.
It states, Mrs Palacio:
All too often Commission decision in the field of competition are presented in the press a defeat for national interest rather than victory for the internal market and for the consumer.'
Our intention is to have more and more of these victory and to be more and more able to explain them to European consumer and to European citizens.
Of course, Parliament ha a very important role to play in this respect.
Mr President, I would just like to set the record straight for the benefit of the Commissioner.
I would not presume to speak on behalf of the whole of Parliament, and certainly not in advance of a vote on the matter.
I merely want to clarify that I spoke here on behalf of the second largest group, and expressed a real concern of ours, and if you heard Mr Caudron speak, then you would be aware that this is not something I alone am concerned about, because it is also something that bother another MEP.
And so I only spoke on behalf of my Group, and not for Parliament a a whole.
The debate is closed.
