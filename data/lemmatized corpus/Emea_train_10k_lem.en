What is Abilify?
Abilify is a medicine containing the active substance aripiprazole.
It is available a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, a 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablet (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), a an oral solution (1 mg/ ml) and a a solution for injection (7.5 mg/ ml).
What is Abilify used for?
Abilify is used to treat adult with the following mental illnesses: • schizophrenia, a mental illness with a number of symptoms, including disorganised thinking and speech, hallucination (hearing or seeing thing that are not there), suspiciousness and delusion (mistaken beliefs); • bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which patient have manic episode (periods of abnormally high mood), alternating with period of normal mood.
They may also have episode of depression.
Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episode and to prevent manic episode in patient who have responded to the medicine in the past.
The solution for injection is used for the rapid control of agitation or disturbed behaviour when taking the medicine by mouth is not appropriate.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abilify used?
For schizophrenia, the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg by mouth per day.
The maintenance dose is 15 mg once a day, but higher dos may benefit some patients.
For bipolar disorder, the recommended starting dose is 15 mg by mouth once a day, either on it own or in combination with other medicines.
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
To prevent manic episodes, the same dose should be continued.
For both illnesses, the oral solution or orodispersible tablet can be used in patient who have difficulty swallowing tablets.
The orodispersible tablet are taken by being placed on the tongue, where they disintegrate quickly in the saliva, or by mixing them in water before swallowing.

Abilify can be taken with or without food.
The daily dose of Abilify should not exceed 30 mg, but this dose should be used with caution in patient who have severe problem with their liver.
The dose of Abilify should be adjusted in patient who are taking other medicine that are broken down in the same way a Abilify.
Abilify ha not been studied in child aged below 18 year or adult aged over 65 years.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
How doe Abilify work?
The active substance in Abilify, aripiprazole, is an antipsychotic medicine.
Its exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it attache to several different receptor on the surface of nerve cell in the brain.
This disrupts signal transmitted between brain cell by ‘ neurotransmitters’, chemical that allow nerve cell to communicate with each other.
Aripiprazole is thought to act mainly by being a ‘ partial agonist ’ for the receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).
This mean that aripiprazole act like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptors, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters.
Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, aripiprazole help to normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptom and preventing them from returning.
How ha Abilify been studied?
For the treatment of schizophrenia, there were three main short-term study of Abilify tablet lasting four to six weeks, which involved 1,203 patient and compared Abilify with placebo (a dummy treatment).
The effectiveness of Abilify in preventing symptom from returning wa assessed in three study lasting up to a year, two of which used haloperidol (another antipsychotic medicine) a a comparator.
The effectiveness of the solution for injection wa compared with placebo over a period of two hour in two study involving 805 patient with schizophrenia or related condition who were experiencing symptom of agitation.
All of the study measured the change in the patient’ s symptom using a standard scale for schizophrenia.
For the treatment of bipolar disorder, there were eight main study looking at Abilify taken by mouth.
There were five short-term study that compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo over three week in a total of 1,900 patients.
Two of these study used haloperidol and lithium (another antipsychotic medicine) a comparators and continued for a further nine week to look at the maintenance of the effect of the medicines.
Another study compared Abilify with haloperidol over 12 week in 347 patients, and a further study compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo in preventing recurrence in 160 patient whose manic symptom had already been stabilised using Abilify.
The eighth study looked at the effect of adding Abilify or placebo to existing treatment with lithium or valproate (another antipsychotic medicine) in 384 patients.
The effectiveness of Abilify solution for injection wa compared with that of lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and of placebo over a period of two hour in one study involving 301 patient with bipolar disorder who were experiencing symptom of agitation.
All of these study looked at the change in symptom using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or at the number of patient who responded to treatment.
The company also carried out study looking at the absorption of the orodispersible tablet and oral solution by the body.
What benefit ha Abilify shown during the studies?
When used to treat schizophrenia, Abilify wa more effective than placebo in the short-term studies.
In the long-term studies, Abilify wa more effective than placebo, and a effective a haloperidol, after up to a year of treatment.
In both study of the solution for injection, patient receiving Abilify at dos of 5.25, 9.75 or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptom of agitation than those receiving placebo.
When used to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify wa more effective than placebo at reducing manic symptom in four of the five short-term studies.
Abilify also had a similar effect to haloperidol and to lithium over three weeks.
This effect wa maintained for up to 12 weeks.
Abilify wa also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episode returning in previously treated patient for up to 74 weeks, and when it wa used a an add-on to existing treatment.
Injections of Abilify at dos of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than placebo in reducing the symptom of agitation, and were of similar effectiveness to lorazepam.
2/ 3 What is the risk associated with Abilify?
The most common side effect when taking Abilify by mouth (seen in between 1 and 10 patient in 100) are extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or jerking), akathisia (constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), somnolence (sleepiness), sedation (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary hypersecretion (increased production of saliva), fatigue (tiredness), restlessness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and anxiety.
Akathisia is more common in patient with bipolar disorder than in those with schizophrenia.
Between 1 and 10 patient in 100 receiving injection of Abilify experience somnolence, dizziness, headache, akathisia, nausea and vomiting.
For the full list of all side effect reported with Abilify, see the Package Leaflet.
Abilify should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to aripiprazole or any of the other ingredients.
Why ha Abilify been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Abilify’ s benefit are greater than it risk for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episode in bipolar I disorder, and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment.
It also decided that the benefit of the solution for injection outweighed it risk for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviour in patient with schizophrenia or in patient with manic episode in bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.
The Committee recommended that Abilify be given marketing authorisation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered
3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) wa administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorder Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorder Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorder Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorder Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorder Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorder and administration site condition Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorder Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
6 Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.

In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
8 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 weeks.
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
9 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
10 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered
14 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
15 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) wa administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
16 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorder Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorder Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorder Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorder Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorder Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorder and administration site condition Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorder Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
17 Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
19 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 weeks.
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
20 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
21 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered
25 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
26 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) wa administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorder Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorder Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorder Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorder Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorder Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorder and administration site condition Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorder Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
28 Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.
Other findings:

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
30 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 weeks.
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
31 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
32 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
However, the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered
36 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Lactose: patient with rare hereditary problem of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
37 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) wa administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
38 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorder Uncommon: tachycardia* Nervous System disorder Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, sedation, headache Eye disorder Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorder Common: dyspepsia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorder Uncommon: orthostatic hypotension* General disorder and administration site condition Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorder Common: restlessness, insomnia, anxiety Uncommon: depression*
39 Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.
Other findings:
Undesirable effect known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse event and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).
Post-Marketing:
The following adverse event have been reported during post-marketing surveillance.
The frequency of these event is considered not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).
Investigations:

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
41 It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 weeks.
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
42 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
43 Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension.
46 The orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patient dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
47 Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
48 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Phenylketonurics:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).

Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.
Other findings:

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
52 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets, with a similar rate and extent of absorption.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to aripiprazole tablets.
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
54 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension.
58 The orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patient dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
59 Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
60 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Phenylketonurics:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).

Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
64 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets, with a similar rate and extent of absorption.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to aripiprazole tablets.
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
66 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva.
It can be taken with or without liquid.
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult.
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension.
70 The orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablet (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patient dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
71 Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
72 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Phenylketonurics:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablet contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean
73 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).

Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.

In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.

jaundice, hepatitis, increased Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), increased Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), increased alkaline phosphatase
Reproductive system and breast disorders:
priapism
Psychiatric disorders:
agitation, nervousness; suicide attempt, suicidal ideation, and completed suicide (see section 4.4)
4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
76 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets, with a similar rate and extent of absorption.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet may be used a an alternative to aripiprazole tablets.
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
78 Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patient who experienced predominantly manic episode and whose manic episode responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
ABILIFY oral solution may be used a an alternative to ABILIFY tablet for patient who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablet (see section 5.2).
Schizophrenia:
10 or 15 ml solution/ day) with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
A calibrated measuring cup and a 2 ml calibrated dropper are included in the carton.
10 to 30 ml solution/ day).
Enhanced efficacy at dos higher than a daily dose of 15 mg ha not been demonstrated although individual patient may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episodes:
15 ml solution/ day) administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meal a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patient may benefit from a higher dose.
30 ml solution/ day).
Recurrence prevention of manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
82 For preventing recurrence of manic episode in patient who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations.
In these patient dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patient 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 4.4 and 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, condition which would predispose patient to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.
Conduction abnormalities:
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
83 Tardive dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
84 Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Intolerance:
The oral solution contains fructose.
Patients with rare hereditary problem of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.
The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reaction (possibly delayed).
The oral solution contains sucrose.
Patients with rare hereditary problem of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the oral solution.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
85 When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) wa administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).

In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.
Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patient a compared to 2.0% of patient who received placebo.

jaundice, hepatitis, increased Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), increased Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), increased alkaline phosphatase
Reproductive system and breast disorders:
priapism
Psychiatric disorders:
agitation, nervousness; suicide attempt, suicidal ideation, and completed suicide (see section 4.4)
4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
88 Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
Further information on clinical trials:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N = 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N = 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Absorption:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 3-5 hour after dosing.
Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Oral Solution:
Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally a the solution.
At equivalent doses, the peak plasma concentration of aripiprazole (Cmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic
In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole a the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablet in healthy subjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax value wa 122% (N = 30).
The single- dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were
91 observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
ABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviour in patient with schizophrenia or in patient with manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.
Treatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued a soon a clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For intramuscular use.
To enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended.
ABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
ABILIFY solution for injection is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1).
The recommended initial dose for aripiprazole solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered a a single intramuscular injection.
The effective dose range of aripiprazole solution for injection is 5.25-15 mg a a single injection.
A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of individual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal product already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).
A second injection may be administered 2 hour after the first injection, on the basis of individual clinical status and no more than three injection should be given in any 24-hour period.
The maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulation of aripiprazole).
If continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution.
Children and adolescents: there is no experience in child and adolescent under 18 year of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patient with severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to
In these patient dosing should be managed cautiously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patient with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patient with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patient who are 65 year of age or older ha not been established.
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factor warrant (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patient a compared to male patient (see section 5.2).
Smoking status: according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smoker (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducer with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
The efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patient with agitation and disturbed behaviour ha not been established related to condition other than schizophrenia and manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder.
Simultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotic and parenteral benzodiazepine may be associated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression.
If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patient should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5).
Patients receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension.
Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly.
The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection ha not been evaluated in patient with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products).
During antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several day to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illness and mood disorder and in some case ha been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
Close supervision of high-risk patient should accompany antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemiological study found that there wa no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic among patient with bipolar disorder.
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or
In clinical trial of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation wa comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient with a family history of QT prolongation.
Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trial of one year or le duration, there were uncommon report of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If sign and symptom of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptom can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare case of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Clinical manifestation of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).
Additional sign may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develops sign and symptom indicative of NMS, or present with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestation of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Seizure: in clinical trials, uncommon case of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patient who have a history of seizure disorder or have condition associated with seizures.
Elderly patient with dementia-related psychosis:
Increased mortality: in three placebo-controlled trial (n= 938; mean age:
82.4 years; range:
56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patient with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patient treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patient wa 3.5% compared to 1.7% in the placebo group.
Although the cause of death were varied, most of the death appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e. g. pneumonia) in nature.
Cerebrovascular adverse events: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse event (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patient (mean age:
84 years; range:
78-88 years).
Overall, 1.3% of aripiprazole-treated patient reported cerebrovascular adverse event compared with 0.6% of placebo-treated patient in these trials.
This difference wa not statistically significant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there wa a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse event in patient treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some case extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, ha been reported in patient treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factor that may predispose patient to severe complication include obesity and family history of diabetes.
In clinical trial with aripiprazole, there were no significant difference in the incidence rate of hyperglycaemia-related adverse event (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory value compared to placebo.
Precise risk estimate for hyperglycaemia-related adverse event in patient treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agent are not available to allow direct comparisons.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for sign and symptom of hyperglycaemia (such a polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patient with diabetes mellitus or with risk factor for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
96 Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patient due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotic known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain ha been reported post-marketing among patient prescribed ABILIFY.
When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factor such a history of diabetes, thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma.
In clinical trial aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dysphagia: oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drug should be used cautiously in patient at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Hypersensitivity: a with other medication hypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
Due to it α 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole ha the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
Given the primary CNS effect of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal product with overlapping undesirable effect such a sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicine known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal product to affect ABILIFY:
The administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomitantly.
However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation wa greater with the combination a compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone.
A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathway involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme but not CYP1A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smokers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax wa unchanged.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, such a fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63% and 37%, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43%, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentration of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor with ABILIFY, potential benefit should outweigh the potential risk to the patient.
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of it prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, such a itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose reduction should therefore be applied.
97 Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increase in aripiprazole concentration might be expected.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) wa administered alone.
Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric mean of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine.
John's Wort) may be expected to have similar effect and similar dose increase should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there wa no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products:
The administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly.
However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed wa greater with the combination a compared to that observed with lorazepam alone.
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day dos of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).
Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interaction mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole wa administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium, there wa no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trial of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
Animal study could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in human and concern raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole wa excreted in the milk of treated rat during lactation.
It is not known whether aripiprazole is excreted in human milk.
Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
No study on the effect on the ability to drive and use machine have been performed.
However, a with other antipsychotics, patient should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole doe not affect them adversely.
98 4.8 Undesirable effect
The following undesirable effect occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified a possibly medically relevant adverse reaction (*) in clinical trial with aripiprazole solution for injection (see section 5.1):

Extrapyramidal symptom (EPS):
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patient had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 19% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS wa 26.6% for patient treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS wa 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patient and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patient wa 12.1% with aripiprazole and 3.2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patient the incidence of akathisia wa 6.2% with aripiprazole and 3.0% with placebo.
99 Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patient experiencing potentially clinically significant change in routine laboratory parameter revealed no medically important differences.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone wa identified in adult patient with reported estimated dos up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important sign and symptom observed included lethargy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
In addition, report of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in child have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious sign and symptom reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered.
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias.
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.
Activated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41% and AUC by about 51%, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It ha been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptor and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist property in animal model of dopaminergic hypoactivity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.
Interaction with receptor other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effect of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole dos ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subject for 2 week produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.
101 Further information on clinical trials:
In two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 554 schizophrenic patient presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection wa associated with statistically significant greater improvement in agitation/ behavioural symptom compared to placebo and wa similar to haloperidol.
In one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patient with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection wa associated with statistically significant greater improvement in agitation/ behavioural symptom compared to placebo and wa similar to the reference arm lorazepam.
The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint wa 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for aripiprazole.
In subpopulation analysis on patient with mixed episode or on patient with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population wa observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size.
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trial involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole wa associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in psychotic symptom compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patient who have shown an initial treatment response.
In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patient maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks wa similar in both group (oral aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate wa significantly higher for patient on oral aripiprazole (43%) than for oral haloperidol (30%).
Actual score in rating scale used a secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patient with chronic schizophrenia, oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in oral aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trial oral aripiprazole ha not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patient and where the primary end-point wa weight gain, significantly le patient had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).
Manic episode in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole:
In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptom over 3 weeks.
These trial included patient with or without psychotic feature and with or without a rapid-cycling course.
In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trial in patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patient in symptomatic remission from mania a lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patient with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 week at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole a adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptom than lithium or valproate monotherapy.
102 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patient who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Absorption:
Aripiprazole solution for injection administered intramuscularly a a single-dose to healthy subject is well absorbed and ha an absolute bioavailability of 100%.
The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hour after an intramuscular injection wa 90% greater than the AUC after the same dose a a tablet; systemic exposure wa generally similar between the 2 formulations.
In 2 study in healthy subject the median time to the peak plasma concentration were 1 and 3 hour after dosing.
Distribution:
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution.
At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin.
Metabolism:
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzyme are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation.
At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.
Elimination:
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hour in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hour in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg, which is primarily hepatic.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radioactivity wa recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole wa excreted in the urine and approximately 18% wa recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokinetics in special patient group
Elderly:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no difference in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subject nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Race:
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation ha revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related difference or effect from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
103 Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristic of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patient with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.
Hepatic Disease:
A single-dose study in subject with varying degree of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patient with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusion on their metabolic capacity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Administration of aripiprazole solution for injection wa well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rat or monkey after repeated dosing at systemic exposure (AUC) that were 15 and 5 times, respectively, human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular.
In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies, no new safety concern were observed at maternal exposure up to 15 (rat) and 29 (rabbit) time human exposure at 30 mg.
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for human based on conventional oral aripiprazole study of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
Toxicologically significant effect were observed only at dos or exposure that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effect were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.
These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rat after 104 week at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinoma and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinoma in female rat at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rat wa 7 time the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional finding wa cholelithiasis a a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy metabolite of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose 2 or 16 to 81 time the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m).
However, the concentration of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentration found in the monkey in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limit of in vitro solubility.
Based on result of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests, aripiprazole wa considered non-genotoxic.
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies.
Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rat at dos resulting in subtherapeutic exposure (based on AUC) and in rabbit at dos resulting in exposure 3 and 11 time the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Maternal toxicity occurred at dos similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity.

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ABRAXANE
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the study performed, to reach their recommendation on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Abraxane?
Abraxane is a powder that is made up into a suspension for infusion (drip into a vein).
It contains the active substance paclitaxel (5 mg/ ml).
What is Abraxane used for?
Abraxane is used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patient whose first treatment for their metastatic disease ha stopped working and for whom standard treatment including an ‘ anthracycline’ (a type of anticancer medicine) is not suitable. ‘ Metastatic’ mean that the cancer ha spread to other part of the body.
Abraxane is used on it own.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abraxane used?
Abraxane should only be given under the supervision of a specialist cancer doctor in ward that are specialised in giving ‘ cytotoxic’ (cell-killing) medicines.
The recommended dose is 260 mg per square metre of body surface area (calculated using the patient ’ s height and weight).
It is given over a period of 30 minutes, every three weeks.
The dose may be reduced or treatment interrupted in patient who have certain side effect affecting the blood or the nerves.
Abraxane should not be used in patient who have severe problem with their liver.
The appropriate dos for patient with mild or moderate liver problem or with kidney problem are not known.
How doe Abraxane work?
The active substance in Abraxane, paclitaxel, belongs to the group of anticancer medicine known a the ‘ taxanes’.
Paclitaxel block the ability of cancer cell to break down their internal ‘ skeleton ’ that allows them to divide and multiply.
With their skeleton still in place, the cell cannot divide and they eventually die.
Abraxane also affect non-cancer cell such a blood and nerve cells, which can cause side effects.
Paclitaxel ha been available a an anticancer medicine since 1993.
Conventional type of paclitaxel contain substance (solvents) that dissolve the paclitaxel, but can cause side effects.
Abraxane doe not contain these solvents.

How ha Abraxane been studied?
The effect of Abraxane were first tested in experimental model before being studied in humans.
The company also presented data from the published literature.
The effectiveness of Abraxane ha been studied in one main study involving 460 woman with metastatic breast cancer, around three-quarters of whom had received an anthracycline in the past.
Around half of the patient in the study had already received treatment for their cancer after it had become metastatic.
The effect of Abraxane (given on it own) were compared with those of a conventional paclitaxel- containing medicine (given together with other medicine to reduce side effects).
The main measure of effectiveness wa the number of patient who ‘ responded ’ after at least five week of treatment.
This wa defined a the patient’ s main tumour having disappeared or having shrunk in size by at least 30%.
What benefit ha Abraxane shown during the studies?
Abraxane wa more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines.
Overall, in the main study, 72 (31%) of the 229 woman receiving Abraxane responded to treatment, compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 receiving conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines.
When looking only at the patient who were receiving their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer, there wa no difference between the medicine in term of measure of effectiveness such a the time until the disease got worse and survival.
In contrast, in patient who had taken other treatment for metastatic breast cancer before, these additional measure showed that Abraxane wa more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines.
Therefore, the company withdrew it application for the use of Abraxane a first-line treatment during the assessment of the medicine.
What is the risk associated with Abraxane?
The most common side effect with Abraxane (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are neutropenia (low level of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), anaemia (low red blood cell counts), leucopenia (low level of leucocytes, a type of white blood cell), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), lymphopenia (low level of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hand and feet), neuropathy (nerve damage), hypoaesthesia (reduced sense of touch), paraesthesia (unusual sensation like pin and needles), nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, stomatitis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth), alopecia (hair loss), rash, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), anorexia (loss of appetite), fatigue (tiredness), asthenia (weakness) and pyrexia (fever).
For the full list of all side effect reported with Abraxane, see the Package Leaflet.
Abraxane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients.
It should also not be used in patient who are breast feeding or who have low level of neutrophil in the blood before starting treatment.
Why ha Abraxane been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane wa more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicine in patient whose first treatment had stopped working, and that, unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicines, it doe not need other medicine to reduce side effects.
The Committee decided that Abraxane’ s benefit are greater than it risk for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patient who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated.
The Committee recommended that Abraxane be given marketing authorisation.
Other information about Abraxane:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abraxane to Abraxis BioScience Limited on 11 January 2008.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patient who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated (See also section 4.4).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in unit specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents.
The procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6.
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minute every 3 weeks.
Dose adjustment during treatment:
Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses.
Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy, additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/ m2.
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil count recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l.
For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses.
2 Patients with hepatic impairment:
Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modification in patient with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see section 4.4. and 5.2).
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel.
Patients with impaired renal function:
Studies in patient with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modification in patient with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric patients:
Abraxane is not recommended for use in child below age 18 year due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.
Elderly patients:
In the clinical studies, no toxicity occurred notably more frequently among elderly patient who received Abraxane.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Lactation.
Patients who have baseline neutrophil count < 1.5 x 109/ l.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have substantially different pharmacological property compared to other formulation of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2)..
Hypersensitivity:
If hypersensitivity occurs, the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately, symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel.
Haematology:
Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) occurs frequently with Abraxane.
Neutropenia is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity.
Frequent monitoring of blood cell count should be performed during Abraxane therapy.
Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycle of Abraxane until neutrophil recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelet recover to > 100 x 109/ l.
Neuropathy:
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane, although development of severe symptom is le common.
The occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy doe not generally require dose reduction.
If grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent course of Abraxane is recommended (see section 4.2).
3 Hepatic Impairment:
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression, and such patient should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression.
The use of Abraxane ha not been formally studied in patient specifically with hepatic impairment.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.
The appropriate dose regimen in patient with le severe hepatic impairment is unknown.
Cardiotoxicity:
While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane ha not been demonstrated, cardiac event are not uncommon in the indicated population, especially in patient who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.
Thus patient receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physician for the occurrence of cardiac events.
Sexually active men and woman should use effective method of contraception during treatment and up to six month after treatment for men, and one month after treatment for woman (see section 4.6).
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patient with central nervous system (CNS) metastasis ha not been established.
CNS metastasis are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy.
Gastrointestinal Symptoms:
If patient experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane, they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents.
Excipients:
When reconstituted, Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose.
To be taken into consideration by patient on a controlled sodium diet.
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No interaction study have been performed.
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 (see section 5.2).
Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicine known to inhibit (e. g. erythromycin, fluoxetine, imidazole antifungals) or induce (e. g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4.
Abraxane is indicated for mono-therapy.
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy:
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy.
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defect when administered during pregnancy.
Studies in animal have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy, and in woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel.
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane.
Male patient treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six month after treatment.
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk.
Because of potential serious adverse reaction in breast-feeding infants, Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation.
Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy.
Abraxane induced infertility in male rat (see section 5.3).
Male patient should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abraxane ha minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Abraxane may cause side effect such a tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery.
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machine if they feel tired or dizzy.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The following are the most common and important incidence of adverse reaction related to 229 patient with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once every three week in the pivotal phase III clinical study.
Neutropenia wa the most notable important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients), and wa rapidly reversible and dose dependent; leukopenia wa reported in 71% of patients.
Grade 4 neutropenia (< 0.5 x 109/ l) occurred in 9% of patient treated with Abraxane.
Febrile neutropenia occurred in four patient on Abraxane.
Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/ dl) wa observed in 46% of patient on Abraxane, and wa severe (Hb < 8 g/ dl) in three cases.
Lymphopenia wa observed in 45% of the patients.
In general, the frequency and severity of neurotoxicity wa dose-dependent in patient receiving Abraxane.
Peripheral neuropathy (mostly Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy) wa observed in 68% of patient on Abraxane with 10% being Grade 3, and no case of Grade 4.
Gastrointestinal disorders:
Nausea occurred in 29% of the patient and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients.
Alopecia wa observed in 90% of the patient treated with Abraxane.
Arthralgia occurred in 32% of patient on Abraxane and wa severe in 6% of cases.
Myalgia occurred in 24% of patient on Abraxane and wa severe in 7% of cases.
The symptom were usually transient, typically occurred three day after Abraxane administration and resolved within a week.
Asthenia/ Fatigue wa reported in 40% of the patients.

Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reaction is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patient
Post-marketing experience
Cranial nerve palsies, vocal cord paresis, and rare report of severe hypersensitivity reaction have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane.
In some patient previously exposed to capecitabine, report of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported a part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane.
Because these event have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, true estimate of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the event ha not been established.
4.9 Overdose
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be closely monitored.
Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities, which are bone marrow suppression, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Taxanes, ATC Code:
L01CD01
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubule from tubulin dimer and stabilises microtubule by preventing depolymerisation.
This stability result in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions.
In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal array or “ bundle ” of microtubule throughout the cell cycle and multiple aster of microtubule during mitosis.
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles.
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituent and in vitro study demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells.
It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor, and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine).
Breast carcinoma:
Data from 106 patient accrued in two single-arm open-label study and from 454 patient treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer.
This information is presented below.
Single-arm open-label study
In one study, Abraxane wa administered a a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patient with metastatic breast cancer.
The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 a a 30 minute infusion in 63 patient with metastatic breast cancer.
Patients were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support.
Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals.
The response rate in all patient were 39.5% (95% CI:
24.9% - 54.2%) and 47.6%
35.3% - 60.0%), respectively.
The median time to disease progression wa 5.3 month (175 mg/ m2; 95% CI:
4.6 – 6.2 months) and 6.1 month (300 mg/ m2; 95% CI:
4.2 – 9.8 months).
Randomised comparative study:
This multi-centre trial wa conducted in patient with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every 3 week with single-agent paclitaxel, either a solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given a a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or a Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given a a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).
Sixty-four percent of patient had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had visceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 site of metastases.
Fourteen percent of the patient had not received prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the metastatic setting only, and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings.
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product a second or greater than second-line therapy.
Seventy-seven percent of the patient had been previously exposed to anthracyclines.
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression, and progression-free survival and survival for patient receiving > 1st-line therapy, are shown below.

Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel wa evaluated through improvement by one grade for patient experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy.
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 course of treatment wa not evaluated and remains unknown.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane at dose level of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies.
The drug exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng. hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2.
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patient with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2, paclitaxel plasma concentration declined in a multiphasic manner.
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel, which occurred at the end of the infusion, wa 18.7 µg/ ml.
The mean total clearance wa 15 l/ hr/ m2.
The terminal half-life wa about 27 hours.
The mean volume of distribution wa 632 l/ m2; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel.
In a study in patient with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristic of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minute were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours.
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane wa larger (43%) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and it volume of distribution wa also higher (53%).
Differences in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected difference in total dose and rate of infusion.
There were no difference in terminal half-lives.
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90%.
Based on the published literature, in vitro study of binding to human serum proteins, using paclitaxel at concentration ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM, indicate that about 87% of paclitaxel is bound; the presence of ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.
Based on the published literature, in vitro study with human liver microsome and tissue slice show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel; and to two minor metabolites, 3’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3’ -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel.
The formation of these hydroxylated metabolite is catalysed by CYP2C8, -3A4, and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively.
The effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel ha not been formally investigated.
Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patient aged over 65 year seems comparable to that in patient le than 65 years.
However, little information in patient over 75 year is available a only 3 patient over 75 year of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel ha not been studied.
However, based on the published literature, paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses, based upon it pharmacodynamic mechanism of action.
Paclitaxel ha been shown to be clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice).

11 Reconstitution and administration of the product:
Abraxane is supplied a a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use.
After reconstitution, each ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel.
Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute.
The solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial.
The solution should not be injected directly onto the powder a this will result in foaming.
Once the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minute to ensure proper wetting of the solid.
Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/ or inverted for at least 2 minute until complete resuspension of any powder occurs.
The generation of foam must be avoided.
If foaming or clumping occurs, the solution must stand for at least 15 minute until foam subsides.
The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates.
If precipitate or settling are visible, the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use.
Some settling of the reconstituted suspension may occur.
Complete resuspension should be ensured by mild agitation before use.
Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitate are observed.
Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ ml suspension required for the patient and inject the appropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-PVC type intravenous bag.
The use of specialized DEHP-free solution container or administration set is not necessary to prepare or administer Abraxane infusions.
In-line filter should not be used.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ABSEAMED
EPAR summary for the public
This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the study performed, to reach their recommendation on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Abseamed?
Abseamed is a solution for injection.
It is available in pre-filled syrinx containing between 1,000 and 10,000 international unit (IU) of the active substance, epoetin alfa.
Abseamed is a ‘ biosimilar’ medicine.
This mean that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also known a the ‘ reference medicine’).
The reference medicine for Abseamed is Eprex/ Erypo.
For more information on biosimilar medicines, see the question-and-answer document here.
What is Abseamed used for?
Abseamed is used in the following situations: • to treat anaemia (low red blood cell counts) that is causing symptom in patient with ‘ chronic renal failure’ (long-term, progressive decrease in the ability of the kidney to work properly) or other kidney problems; • to treat anaemia in adult receiving chemotherapy for certain type of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusions; • to increase the amount of blood that can be take in adult patient with moderate anaemia who are going to have an operation and donate their own blood before surgery (autologous blood transfusion); • to reduce the need for blood transfusion in adult with mild anaemia who are about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery, such a hip surgery.
It is used in patient with normal blood iron level who could experience complication if they were to receive a blood transfusion, if they do not have the opportunity to donate their own blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,800 ml of blood.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abseamed used?
Treatment with Abseamed must be started under the supervision of a doctor who ha experience in the management of patient with the condition that the medicine is used for.
For patient with kidney problem and patient who are going to donate their own blood, Abseamed must be injected into a vein.
Patients receiving chemotherapy or about to undergo orthopaedic surgery receive it under the skin.
Abseamed can be injected under the skin by the patient or their carer if they

For full details, see the Package Leaflet.
How doe Abseamed work?
A hormone called erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cell from the bone marrow.
In patient receiving chemotherapy or with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a lack of erythropoietin, or by the body not responding enough to the erythropoietin it ha naturally.
In these cases, erythropoietin is used to replace the missing hormone or to increase red blood cell counts.
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cell and help minimise the consequence of blood loss.
The active substance in Abseamed, epoetin alfa, is a copy of human erythropoietin and work in exactly the same way a the natural hormone to stimulate red blood cell production.
The epoetin alfa in Abseamed is produced by ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that ha received a gene (DNA), which make it able to produce epoetin alfa.
How ha Abseamed been studied?
Abseamed wa studied to show that it is comparable with the reference medicine, Eprex/ Erypo, in experimental model and in humans.
Abseamed, injected into a vein, wa compared with the reference medicine in one main study involving 479 patient with anaemia caused by kidney problems.
All of the patient had been taking Eprex/ Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight week before they were either switched to Abseamed or remained on Eprex/ Erypo.
The main measure of effectiveness wa the change in the level of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period, between week 25 and 29.
The company also presented the result of a study comparing the effect of Abseamed injected under the skin with those of Eprex/ Erypo in 114 cancer patient who were receiving chemotherapy.
What benefit ha Abseamed shown during the studies?
Abseamed wa a effective a Eprex/ Erypo in increasing and maintaining red blood cell counts.
In the study of patient with anaemia caused by kidney problems, patient switching to Abseamed maintained haemoglobin level to the same extent a those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo.
On average, the level of the patient taking Abseamed increased by 0.147 g/ dl from a starting value of 11.7 g/ dl.
In comparison, those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g/ dl from a starting value of 12.0 g/ dl.
The study in patient receiving chemotherapy showed that Abseamed wa also a effective a Eprex/ Erypo when it wa injected under the skin.
What is the risk associated with Abseamed?
The most common side effect with Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can sometimes lead to symptom of encephalopathy (brain problems) such a sudden, stabbing migraine-like headache and confusion.
Abseamed can also lead to skin rash and flu-like symptoms.
For the full list of all side effect reported with Abseamed, see the Package Leaflet.
Abseamed should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.
It must not be used in the following groups: • patient who have developed pure red cell aplasia (reduced or stopped red blood cell production) following treatment with any erythropoietin; • patient with high blood pressure that is not controlled; • patient who are going to donate their own blood who have had a heart attack or stroke within the last month, who have angina pectoris (a severe type of chest pain) or who are at risk of deep 2/ 3 venous thrombosis (DVT: formation of blood clot in the deep vein of the body, usually in the leg); • patient who cannot receive medicine for the prevention of blood clots; • patient about to undergo major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) problem including a recent heart attack or stroke.
Abseamed is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problem because further study are needed to make sure that this doe not cause allergic reactions.
Why ha Abseamed been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, Abseamed ha been shown to have a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile to Eprex/ Erypo.
Therefore, the CHMP’ s view wa that, a for Eprex/ Erypo, the benefit outweighs the identified risks.
The Committee recommended that Abseamed be given marketing authorisation.
Which measure are being taken to ensure the safe use of Abseamed?
The company that make Abseamed will provide information pack for healthcare worker in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.
The company will also provide cool box for patients, which will include illustration showing how the medicine should be used.
Other information about Abseamed:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Abseamed to Medice Arzneimittel Pütter GmbH & Co KG on 28 August 2007.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
2 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
3 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
5 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
8 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
9 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
12 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
16 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
17 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
19 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
20 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
22 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
23 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
25 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
26 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
30 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
31 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
33 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
34 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
36 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
37 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
39 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
40 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
44 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
45 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
47 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl

If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
48 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
50 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
51 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
53 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
54 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
58 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
59 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
61 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
62 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
64 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
65 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
67 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
68 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
72 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
73 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
75 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
76 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
78 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
79 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
81 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
82 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
86 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
87 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
89 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
90 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
92 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
93 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
95 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
96 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
100 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
101 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
103 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
104 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
106 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
107 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
109 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
110 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
114 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
115 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
117 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
118 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
120 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
121 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
123 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
124 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indication
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patient on
haemodialysis and adult patient on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptom in adult patient
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirement in adult patient receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion a assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patient in a predonation programme.
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patient with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedure are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more unit of blood for female or 5 or more unit for males).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in adult non-iron deficient patient prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed ha to be initiated under the supervision of physician experienced in the management of patient with the above indications.
128 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patient with chronic renal failure the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patient in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustment should be made a provided.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patient the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptom of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other cause of anaemia, such a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes: iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency; aluminium intoxication; intercurrent infections; inflammatory or traumatic episodes; occult blood loss; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of at least four weeks.
At each step, the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
129 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in step of 25 IU/ kg 3 time per week at interval of at least 4 week until the desired goal is achieved.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Generally, child under 30 kg require higher maintenance dos than child over 30 kg and adults.
The following maintenance dos were observed in clinical trial after 6 month of treatment:
Dose (IU/ kg given 3x / week)
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patient whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance dos than those whose initial anaemia is le severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 time per week into 2 equal injections.
Adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increment (3 time per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in step of at least four weeks).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin value at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 time per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patient with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptom and sequela may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin value for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptom of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 time per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin ha increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 week of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 time a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
If after an additional 4 week of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week, the haemoglobin ha increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count ha increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 time per week.
However, if the haemoglobin ha increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count ha increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram:
131 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ d
and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 week
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Discontinue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl:
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50%.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it fall below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme:
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of donating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure.
Mildly anaemic patient (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 unit of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 time weekly for 3 week prior to surgery.
200 mg oral elemental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started a soon a possible, even several week prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron store prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
132 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three week (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In case where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to le than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive day prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four day immediately thereafter.
When performing haematologic assessment during the preoperative period, if the haemoglobin level reach 15 g/ dl, or higher, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further dos should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patient are not iron deficient.
All patient being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron stores.
Method of administration
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.
Administer the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depending on the total dose.
In haemodialysed patients, a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is preferable in patient who react to the treatment with “ flu-like” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded.
In case of larger volumes, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injection are given in the thigh or the anterior abdominal wall.
In chronic renal failure patient Abseamed ha not to be administered subcutaneously!
The intravenous route ha to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).
Uncontrolled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such a history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis.
The use of epoetin alfa in patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patient with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patient with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.
4.4 Special warning and precaution for use
General
In all patient receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled a necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated
It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This regress during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 week of therapy.
All other cause of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin value in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron store should be assured:
- iron supplementation, e. g.
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patient whose serum ferritin level are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patient whose
transferrin saturation is below 20%.
All of these additive factor of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practice should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA ha been very rarely reported after month to year of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patient developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical cause of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell count are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect ha been found, anti-erythropoietin antibody should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.
If anti-erythropoietin, antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction.
Appropriate therapy such a blood transfusion may be given to patient when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patient
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patient at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patient with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.
Therefore, in patient with renal anaemia the medicinal product ha to be administered intravenously.
In patient with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular event wa observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Controlled clinical trial have not shown significant benefit attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptom of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
134 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risk of an increase in hypertension.
Hyperkalaemia ha been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intake.
Dialysis prescription may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolyte should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or rising) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia ha been corrected.
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa a a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum.
In patient with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration a recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis doe not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patient receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cell should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).
Haemoglobin level should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic event (see section 4.2 Treatment of patient with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (TVEs) ha been observed in cancer patient receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (see section 4.8), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa) particularly in cancer patient with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such a obesity and patient with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
An investigational study (BEST study) in woman with metastatic breast cancer wa designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic event wa higher in patient receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In view of the above, in some clinical situation blood transfusion should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patient with cancer.
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and it stage; the degree of anaemia; life-expectancy; the environment in which the patient is being treated; and patient preference (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patient in an autologous predonation programme
All special warning and precaution associated with autologous predonation programmes, especially routine volume replacement, should be respected.
135 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thrombotic event can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, a thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special precaution should be taken in patient with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs).
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patient with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tumour growth potential
Erythropoietins are growth factor that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth factors, there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patient with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs) have shown:
- decreased locoregional control in patient with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.7 mmol/ l),
- shortened overall survival and increased death attributed to disease progression at 4 month in
patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patient with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains le than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essentially “ sodium- free”.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal product and other form of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cell there is potential for an interaction.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood level of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted a the haematocrit rises.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimen in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled study in pregnant women.
Studies in animal have shown reproduction toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequently:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patient participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machine
Abseamed ha no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effect
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom can occur.
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headache a a possible warning signal.
General
Non-specific skin rash have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu-like" symptom such a headaches, joint pains, feeling of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thrombocytosis ha been observed but it occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thrombotic/ vascular events, such a myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patient receiving erythropoietic agents, including patient receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reaction have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated case of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia (PRCA) ha been reported after month to year of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibody to erythropoietin have been observed (see section 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasia)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patient and adult patient with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increase in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reaction have also occurred in isolated patient with normal or low blood pressure: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptom (e. g. headache and confused state) and generalised tonoclonal seizures, requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care.
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headache a a possible warning signal.
Shunt thromboses may occur, especially in patient who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistula exhibit complication (e. g. stenoses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid, for example, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patient with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequently, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
137 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular event (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) ha been observed in patient receiving erythropoietic agents.
Surgery patient in autologous predonation programme
Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular event may occur in surgical patient with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.
Therefore, routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patient scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular event (most of which were DVTs), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing group and placebo group, although the clinical experience is limited.
Moreover, in patient with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular event cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide.
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effect that are extension of the pharmacological effect of the hormone.
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin level occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided a necessary.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic property
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antianaemic, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates, a a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone, the formation of erythrocyte from precursor of the stem cell compartment.
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton.
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58% and consists of 165 amino acids.
The four carbohydrate chain are attached via three N-glycosidic bond and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein.
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in it amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that ha been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed ha the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art.
In particular, no residue of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentration of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa ha been demonstrated in various animal model in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, polycythaemic mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocytes, the Hb value and reticulocyte count increase a well a the 59Fe-incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cell ha been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell culture) after incubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell culture of human bone marrow cell that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and doe not affect leucopoiesis.
Cytotoxic action of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cell could not be detected.
138 721 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patient with haematological malignancy (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumour (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).
In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patient receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumour (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.
In a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patient with various non-myeloid malignancy receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there wa a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequela (e. g. fatigue, decreased energy, and activity reduction), a measured by the following instrument and scales:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other smaller, randomised, placebo-controlled trial failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameter on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptor may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled study involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled study and one wa an open- label study.
The study either recruited patient who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studies) or used patient population in which erythropoiesis stimulating agent are not indicated: anaemia in patient with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patient receiving radiotherapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two study wa > 13 g/ dl; in the remaining three study it wa 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there wa no difference in overall survival between patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled study the hazard ratio for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls.
These study have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patient who have anaemia associated with various common cancer who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Overall survival outcome in the trial could not be statisfactorily explained by difference in the incidence of thrombosis and related complication between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A systematic review ha also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patient participating in 57 clinical trials.
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of control (95% CI:
0.99, 1,18; 42 trial and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic event (RR 1.67, 95% CI:
1.35, 2.06, 35 trial and 6769 patients) wa observed in patient treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic event in patient with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcome might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patient with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentration le than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patient with these characteristic were included in the data reviewed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic property
Intravenous route
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hour in normal volunteer and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hour ha been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum level of epoetin alfa are much lower than the level achieved following intravenous injection, the level increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20th of the value).
There is no accumulation: the level remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hour after the first injection or 24 hour after the last injection.
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some preclinical toxicological study in dog and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy wa associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in human and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis wa not increased in a study of haemodialysis patient who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 year compared to a matched control group of dialysis patient who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa ha been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly dos of approximately 20 time the recommended human weekly dose.
These change are interpreted a being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any change in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity test and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.
Long-term carcinogenicity study have not been carried out.
There are conflicting report in the literature regarding whether erythropoietin may play a major role a tumour proliferators.
These report are based on in vitro finding from human tumour samples, but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation.
