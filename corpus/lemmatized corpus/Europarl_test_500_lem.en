Financial assistance for Member States' balance of payment
The next item is the report (A5-0277/2000) by Mrs Sartori, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balance of payment [COM(1999) 628 - C5-0307/2000 - 2000/0807 (CNS)].
Madam President, lady and gentlemen, today, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am tabling a proposal for a resolution on the Commission's report on the single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balance of payments.
The financial assistance is currently governed by Council Regulation No 1969 of 1988.
This mechanism can be activated either at the request of a Member State or under Article 119 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, a provision which remains in force during the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union for the States which are covered by a derogation, currently Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden.
The regulation and the proposal for a regulation have merged two mechanism (medium-term financial assistance and the Community loan mechanism intended to provide medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balance of payments) into a single facility providing medium-term financial assistance.
This proposal change the mechanism' s ceiling.
The fact that, at the moment, only three country can benefit from it suggests that the amount hitherto available - EUR 16 billion - can be reduced. At the same time, however, past experience tell u that we cannot reduce it by very much, for the very reason that the last time the mechanism wa used, in 1993, the loan wa for EUR 8 billion.
Therefore, although the increase in convergence of States reduces the likelihood that the mechanism will be used, it must still have sufficient resource to meet the simultaneous need of several countries, should this be necessary.
This is why we propose to reduce the amount available from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion.
This resolution also envisages the possibility of considering creating a special mechanism providing financial assistance to the balance of payment of the candidate countries.
Clearly, this is a possibility for the future and therefore doe not have a bearing on the present situation, but it is a possibility which I considered that we could at least examine in some depth so that we will be prepared should these issue arise.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Sartori for her report, which we have found very valuable.
The aim of this Commission report is to provide a basis for examining the single facility providing medium-term financial support and for revising it, should this prove necessary.
The financial mechanism implement Article 119 of the EC Treaty, which only remains in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are not participating in monetary union.
The last assessment wa carried out in October 1997 on the basis of a report drawn up by the Commission.
On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Commission' s position, which recommended that the mechanism should be continued, and decided that a further assessment, carried out according to the same procedure, would be necessary in the light of the change linked to the commencement of the third stage.
The Commission is therefore bound to submit a report to the Council so that the Council can carry out this additional assessment of the mechanism.
The report make three principle recommendations.
Firstly, the single facility should be continued in that it is an instrument implementing Article 119 of the Treaty which will continue to apply to the Member States which are not part of the eurozone; until they participate in the single currency, these Member States, in a similar way to the new Members of the Community, are liable to encounter problem with their balance of payment and therefore to wish to have recourse to the mechanism under consideration.
In view of the current level of economic, financial and monetary integration, the likelihood that these Member States will encounter difficulty related to the balance of payment is extremely low from the institutional point of view, but the mechanism must, nevertheless, remain in force.
Secondly, the possibility of having recourse to fund contributed by other Member States to finance the loan granted under the mechanism should be eliminated since, for various reasons, it ha never been used.
In future, recourse to the capital market should be the only option available.
Thirdly and finally, the drop in the number of Member States who could now apply for this form of financial support and the need to cover the potential borrowing requirement of new Member States justify lowering the mechanism's ceiling from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion.
The Economic and Financial Committee ha drawn up an opinion which it sent to the Presidency on 14 July 2000.
The Committee considers that the conclusion of the analysis of the single facility performed by the Commission are in line with it positions.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
Vegetative propagation of the vine
The next item is the report (A5-0195/2000) by Mrs Klass, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine [COM(2000) 59 - C5-0090/2000 - 200/0036(CNS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, I am grateful for the fact that we are, after all, to have the opportunity to discus the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, and I also hope that tomorrow' s vote will have a positive outcome.
In term of area, production and consumption European wine growing is in a leading position globally.
In several Member States wine growing represents a significant proportion of total agricultural production, and in many region this sector is a crucial source of agricultural income.
Wine growing frequently take place in area in which other form of agricultural activity would be difficult or impossible.
Wine growing is a very varied and dynamic sector characterised by long-established tradition and ancient cultures.
The vine propagating material provides the basis for optimal grape and wine production a regard quality, excellence and quantity, and establishes these factor over a period of 25 to 40 years.
It is thus extremely significant and it is essential to guarantee optimum reliability in term of quality and trueness to variety.
The trade in, and marketing of, material for vegetative propagation of vine has, up to now, been laid down in directive 68/193/EEC dating from 1968.
The directive contains a number of provision which up to now have allowed Member States to make unilateral exemption from some of the rules, and the directive ha already been amended several times.
I welcome the Commission' s proposal for amendments, which ha grouped the amendment needed clearly in a single document and ha also included new amendment arising from new development and knowledge: a for example those concerning new type of propagating material for vine produced from herbaceous cutting and in vitro propagation.
The desired consolidation of the single market is very much to be welcomed.
There is an urgent need to change or abolish old or outdated provision so a to remove existing or potential barrier to trade.
As far a I am concerned, French vine propagator should also be in a position to propagate vine for the German or Italian market, and vice versa.
The specific characteristic of wine production and it further development, in particular in technical and scientific areas, make it essential to stipulate detailed technical provision which will contribute to the smooth operation of the internal market, improve marketing prospect and also protect the legitimate interest of consumer and producers.
Accordingly, the Commission should publish a Community Catalogue of varieties, compiled on the basis of notification from the Member States.
This will bring greater trading security for European wine growers.
Many amendment contain a better definition of term such a 'genotype' , for example.
Accompanying paperwork and control are important, and the Commission must ensure that only one document is required for each party, wherever they happen to be in Europe.
High-quality and healthy vine propagating material is playing an increasingly important role these days.
The report ha taken on a particularly explosive character in the past few weeks.
This is because the Commission is proposing to create a legal basis with regard to genetically modified varieties.
The Commission proposal refers to Council Directive 90/220, which is to regulate all genetically modified material, a a horizontal directive.
We have done the same with respect to forest and plant material.
However, the fact that directive 90/220 is still undergoing the conciliation procedure should not stop u from proceeding in taking exactly the same approach with vine a we have done with forest and plant material.
All the amendment that are currently being introduced with regard to directive 90/220, under the conciliation procedure, will be applicable to vine at a later date.
There is no genetically modified vine propagating material available on the market a yet; however, research is ongoing.
The question a to whether genetically modified vine will be granted a permit at some future date, or whether this idea will be rejected by the wine producer and the wine trade, doe not form part of today' s discussion of the directive.
I am sure we will have the opportunity to discus these matter at length on another occasion.
The directive under discussion today guarantee that traditional vine varieties, which are characteristic of wine growing in the different regions, are to be maintained and protected.
Traditional wine growing is our strength in the European Union, and so it deserves our support.
I would therefore urge the House to assent to the report a it stands, and hope that this will enable the European internal market to be brought into play for vine propagating material.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, the reason we wished to defer this report wa that we wanted to ensure consistency in the work of the European Parliament a it influenced the course of European policy.
The revision of GMO Directive No 90/220 is at the conciliation stage right now.
It would be completely inconsistent not to wait until the end of this procedure before including reference to GMOs in our directive and regulations.
That is why, at the proposal of the draftsman of the opinion, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy ha unanimously voted to do away with all the reference to GMOs in this report.
And please do not tell u that we are barking up the wrong tree, and that this revision doe not have any implication concerning GMOs, since a regulation of this type already exists for forestry.
At the moment, we consume wine, but we do not yet feed on the wood of our forests.
Contrary to what the executive committee and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would have u believe, this revision slyly but irremediably introduces genetically modified vines.
This is a clear indication that the European Parliament would, indirectly, give the green light to GMO experiment in the field of vine propagation or improvement.
Why the rush?
It is not at the request of the winegrowers or wine merchant or vineyard owners.
On 5 July, some of these issued the Beaune declaration, expressing their great concern at the introduction of GMOs into their sector.
We have received a reply from the confederation of producer of registered designation of origin (AOC) wine, saying, "We support the position of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a it offer the guarantee that European regulation are not going to permit the implementation of procedure to authorise the sale of genetically modified wine-growing material which may be harmful to the brand image of wine growing."
Just who is going to benefit from this amended regulation which includes GMOs?
The question - and the answer, of course - will have to come from the Commission, who must also tell u whether it is intending to continue to pave the way for u to end up with GMOs on our plates, and now in our glass too.
This is something that they are achieving, unfortunately, with the assistance of the French Presidency, in a way that is completely out of step with the way European consumer feel.
The previous directive proved to be relevant and effective in enabling, firstly, product to be standardised and the internal Community trade in vine cutting and plant to develop substantially in recent years.
It now need to be revised to take into account development in phytosanitary regulation and scientific and technical progress, particularly in the field of in vitro propagation.
The draft text presented by the European Commission, a amended by the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, proposes some interesting advances. I shall cite the most significant here.
The current draft rule out any possibility of any of the Fifteen Member States enjoying a unilateral exemption from the term of the directive.
This provision, which wa not laid down in the initial version of the directive, is preferable a it make it possible to avoid barrier to trade and to facilitate the movement of propagation material within the European Union.
The material produced by in vitro herbaceous cutting propagation techniques, which by now have been sufficiently mastered were, of course, not covered by the 1968 directive.
The new text introduces provision recognising special characteristics. While research into a propagation material that is more efficient in health term is of benefit to the user, it is important that this approach doe not create a barrier to trade.
The draft amendment seeking to guarantee freedom to market throughout the European Union material that complies with the minimum requirement of the directive should be approved unreservedly.
Finally, we must ensure that the new provision on genetically modified variety are in every respect compliant and compatible with existing texts, or text in preparation, in this field.
Should this regulatory mechanism need to be expanded or clarified, it would be preferable to delete the provision relating to this point from the draft directive.
We have reason to believe that the new or updated term of the proposed directive offer a satisfactory response to the expectation of worker in the vine nursery and wine-growing sector and that they should contribute towards improving the quality of the proposed material and make it easier for the competent authority to supervise the movement of vine cutting and plant carried out by the institution responsible for this.
The regulation proposed by the directive, moreover, favour the production of diversified plant material by offering the best health guarantees, which is a basic requirement, in order to effectively support the restructuring of the Community vineyard sector, which is a key point in the new COM in wine-growing.
Mr President, the need for a new directive revising the condition for the marketing on Community territory of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine ha become urgent.
The base legislation in force date from 1968, a long way back, and a great deal of progress had been made in this sector since then: new material have been tried out, often using natural method and sometimes genetic modification.
Hence the urgent need for a modern regulation which recognises these new possibility available to European vine grower and, at the same time, protects traditional variety of vine.
It is my opinion that the Klass report should be adopted, particularly in view of the additional guarantee provided by amendment such a that tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which clarifies the reference to directive 90/220, in the form in which it is going to be amended in respect of GMOs.
Another amendment, tabled by Mr Garot and myself, refers once again to the precautionary principle and provides for the protection of those traditional form of vine which would otherwise be overtaken by new experimental varieties.
I also feel that, abiding by this precautionary principle, referring to the possibility of genetic modification, means, for example, cutting down on the intensive use of phytosanitary treatments.
The amendment tabled by Mrs Auroi and the Chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developmen, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf a a further guarantee precisely of experimental varieties, are precautionary.
From this point of view, I therefore consider that Mrs Klass' report follows the right line in a sector which is in urgent need of new legislation, a key, strategic sector for agriculture and the European wine industry.
Mr President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, what is the point of turning a technical report into a potential oenological disaster.
The determination to amend the directive on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine may look like a laudable initiative to update a rather technical text, which is 32 year old.
Personally, I find the ' 68 vintage rather a fine one, but apparently the Commission ha decided to modernise.
The very first line of the Klass report clearly stress the value, not just the economic value but also the cultural value, of grape and wine production.
Everything, then, could be for the best in the best of all possible European wine-growing worlds.
Well, a it turn out, that is not the case.
The Commission ha taken the opportunity of updating matter to open a Pandora' s box, even though this wa something that not one European producer wa looking for.
While the Commission appears to be overcome with combined GMO and cloning fever, Mrs Klass go further and go into convulsions, compounding the GMO issue with all the genotype she see all around her.
It must be said loud and clear, there wa absolutely no need to stuff the article of this directive with reference to directive 90/220, which is currently being revised, unless the intention wa to promote genetic manipulation in vine at all costs.
And please do not tell me that this wa done to anticipate this directive' s being revised or because GM vine do not exist except in laboratory experiments!
Commissioner, Mrs Klass, listen to the opinion of the expert from the Institut national de appellation d'origine, the French National Appellations Institute.
The INAO has, on the basis of the information currently available, issued a blanket ban on the use of GMOs in any area whatsoever, which would therefore include, and I quote, genetically modified wine variety and rootstocks.
Would you care to read the Beaune declaration presented by the winegrowers of the Burgundy region?
Do you wish to show the industry that Europe is working for better quality and respect the precautionary principle?
Commissioner, withdraw the recital and the article incorporating GMOs and cloning into this draft.
Mrs Klass, take out your amendment and let the relationship between GMOs and genotype be clarified by the scientists.
There is a second problem area, Mrs Klass.
You restrict the practice of grafting to herbaceous cutting alone.
In so doing, you protect what go on in your own region, but rule out the grafting of hardwood cutting in the winter period, even though this is the grafting technique that is the most widely used in Europe.
This amendment should, therefore, be withdrawn.
In conclusion, lady and gentlemen, in order to respect the precautionary principle in both spirit and letter, should the article and amendment which I have just mentioned not be withdrawn, then, a the wine grower themselves demand, we would have to fall in with the opinion of Marianne Isler Béguin, and the Committee on the Environment, and vote against them.
Mr President, rapporteur, I would like to congratulate you on your report.
There ha been some turmoil lately, and I believe the genetically modified organism will, of course, be inclined to dispute the purport of this directive.
But in all fairness, it ha to be said that no one is forced to use genetically modified material.
It ha had no place in viticulture so far.
I am fundamentally opposed to genetically modified organism and am a wine lover, and I would very much like to stick with the wine we have been producing to date.
I therefore welcome the fact that we have placed additional emphasis on traditional, regional type of wine.
When it come to genetically modified material, I take the view that the reference made in this report to directive 90/220 secures legal protection.
Any prospective changes, will, and must, be made to this end.
In addition, Mrs Klass, it is, however, important to stress the political dimension a well a the legal aspect, particularly where viticulture is concerned, and - providing we manage to do so - to keep viticulture free of genetically modified material if at all possible.
I hope that the wine grower will have no truck with GMOs, for their own sake, because we know that consumer strongly disapprove.
I hope this will inspire u to rule out the possibility of having genetically modified vines.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the rapporteur, Mrs Klass, for their extremely positive reception of the Commission' s proposal.
The Commission appreciates the wide consensus on it proposal.
Its aim is to strengthen the internal market in the sector in question, to update the legislation in the light of technical and scientific progress which ha taken place since it wa last updated and to ensure that authorisation for genetically modified variety can only be granted if the appropriate step have been taken to avoid endangering human health or the environment.
With regard to the third point, in it current form, the proposal contains reference both to the development of a specific procedure for assessing the risk to the environment, which is similar to the procedure laid down by directive 90/220 in term of the risk to man and the environment, and to the criterion and assessment principle laid down in Regulation 258/97 on novel food and novel food ingredients.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development ha tabled 26 amendments.
The Commission is able to accept the majority of them, that is 24 out of 26 amendments, a they are currently worded or with minor change relating to the way they are worded or presented.
For example, the proposal to recognise the specific characteristic of the genotype, referred to in Amendments Nos 4, 12, 15, 16 and 20, will be incorporated by changing the wording of the text.
The genetic diversity of the variety with genotype which are suitable for specific local environment will be taken into consideration in discussion on the appropriateness of continuing the possibility of marketing material for propagating these varieties, on the basis of Article 3, paragraph 5, point A of the directive.
With reference to the other two amendments, Amendments Nos 2 and 18, we can only partially accept them for the reason that certain aspect are unjustifiably aggressive towards other country - Amendment 2 - or because the reference to the Commission' s obligation to provide greater resource should a common catalogue of variety be compiled - Amendment No 18 - is superfluous.
Lastly, we can accept Amendment No 27, tabled by both Mr Lavarra and Mr Garot.
I am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept Amendments Nos 35 to 40, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirement according to directive 90/220.
However, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 28 to 34 tabled by Mrs Isler-Béguin and others, for they would involve revoking the entire part of the directive which contains reference to the GMO variety and the related risk assessment.
Moreover, these amendment have already been discussed but not accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We cannot accept Amendment No 41, tabled by Mrs Schierhuber, either, for it concern an excessively detailed definition in the light of the amendment proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
If we were to accept this amendment, we would be running the risk of creating artificial barrier to trade, which would be contrary to the principle aim of the proposal for a directive which is to consolidate the internal market.
Mr President, lady and gentlemen, thank you for your attention and, once again, thank you to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Mr President, if you permit, I should like to ask the Commissioner to give an opinion on the amendment put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Amendment No 1.
The response is affirmative, Mr President. The amendment ha been accepted.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
(The sitting wa closed at 9.17 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, I see from Item 13 of the Minutes, entitled 'Communication of the announcement of the removal of Mr Le Pen from office' , that you presumed to speak on behalf of Parliament, and that the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs presumed to speak on behalf of that committee.
I would simply like to point out that Parliament wa not in itself called upon to give an opinion.
As for Mrs Palacio' s interpretation of events, I have a great deal of respect for the chairman on a personal level but none at all for her interpretation, which derives from a prior decision by the Committee made when it chose to postpone ruling on this issue.
While the Council of State wa in the process of examining the appeal lodged by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the committee in no way refrained from discussing the consequence of this appeal, nor even from assessing the decision taken.
This situation seems to me all the more serious since while French law expressly stipulates that a ruling from the Council of State concerning a Member of the European Parliament must be given in plenary session, it wa only pronounced in this case by two sub-sections, which constitutes a serious breach of Mr Le Pen' s rights.
As a result, I consider that Article 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure ha not been respected.
Mr Gollnisch, I can assure you that procedure have been respected absolutely, in both the spirit and the letter of Article 12(2) of the Act of 20 September 1976.
The only issue open to debate is whether or not I should have taken note of the decree terminating Mr Le Pen' s mandate a soon a the French government notified me of it.
As you know, the Committee on Legal Affairs advised me to wait for the decision from the Council of State, which I did.
However, everything wa done exactly by the book, and in conformity with the Rules of Procedure.
Madam President, the Minutes state that I spoke on the situation in Spain.
I spoke on the repression in Spain and the situation in the Basque country, which is totally different.
I would not speak about ETA terrorist act and say I am speaking about the situation in Spain.
This ha not been fairly reported in the Minutes.
I would say that I spoke on the situation in the Basque country and about the Spanish Government' s repression.
You can check it in the verbatim report of proceedings.
Madam President, I speak with regard to Item 14 of the Minutes on the waiver of Mr Pacheco Pereira' s parliamentary immunity.
We opposed this waiver, Madam President, which answer the question that you were just asking, in the name - to quote from Paragraph D of Mr MacCormick' s report - in the name of the "independent nature of European parliamentary immunity compared with national parliamentary immunity" .
I would remind you that the Greek word for such independence would be 'auto nomoi' , which mean 'having it own laws' , and a the rapporteur say "its own rules" .
It follows that, if the Parliament ha it own rule concerning the waiver of parliamentary immunity and if it discretion is not limited when the national authority requires that immunity be waived, then it is even more true that, this being so much more minor an issue, it also ha it own rule when it is required to terminate a Member of Parliament' s mandate. It ha it own laws, it 'autonomy' , it ha discretionary power and it discretion is not limited.
Yesterday, Madam President, you had discretionary powers, a did Parliament, and there were no limit on this discretionary power.
That wa the legal error on your part, Madam President.
Mr Martinez, you have jumped the gun on the vote on the report concerning Mr Pacheco Pereira.
I would remind you that the vote is to take place at 12.30.
(The Minutes were approved)
Madam President, on a point of order.
Following the Danish referendum will you now write to the Danish Prime Minister to congratulate the Danish people on having struck an historic blow for freedom, democracy and the nation state?
The euro wa meant to symbolise the strength and unity of Europe ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is not a point of order, Mr Helmer.
At least in this case, that is very clear.
Informal European Council in Biarritz (13/14 October 2000)
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the Informal European Council in Biarritz, held on 13 and 14 October 2000.
Madam President, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to return to this House - a the French Presidency undertook to do on 3 October - to present the result of the Informal European Council in Biarritz to which, Madam President, you, a ever, made a highly valued contribution.
As I have mentioned previously, most of the time available wa taken up with the institutional reform currently being examined at the Intergovernmental Conference, which I think wa a it should be, and I will therefore begin with them.
As to the IGC, I believe that work at ministerial level had already progressed a far a it could before Biarritz, and this Informal Council thus came at the just the right time to consolidate certain advance and to lay down guideline for the final phase of the work, on which we have now embarked.
Next, tangible progress wa made on qualified majority voting and closer cooperation. Lastly, there came what I will call the opening up of a substantive debate at the highest level on the two most sensitive issues: the re-weighting of vote and the Commission, which ha enabled u to truly enter into discussion on these two tricky issues.
Let me expand on the issue of qualified majority voting.
A fairly broad consensus wa reached on over half of the item under discussion, while way of arriving at potential solution to sensitive issue were also outlined.
Thus, while certain deep-seated reservation persist concerning taxation, some form of progress will still be possible thanks to the technical adjustment that the Presidency is to look into with the help of the Commission.
We have established that there is a clear desire to open up to cooperation in the area of combating tax fraud, and this is no small thing.
I feel that we should also be able to make headway in the field of social affairs, on the proviso that we do not tamper with the principle that underpin the various national social security systems, which give u some room for manoeuvre.
Progress will also be possible in the field of external trade policy, but only when we find a way of dealing with the most sensitive issue on a specific basis and also avert a backdoor extension of Community competences.
In the field of justice and home affairs, I am optimistic that a solution will be found concerning judicial cooperation in civil cases.
On the other hand, issue relating to asylum, visa and immigration are still proving much more sensitive.
Lastly, certain other problem remain, not least in the field of non-discrimination and the environment.
Significant progress ha thus been made even if certain advance still have to be consolidated.
Concerning closer cooperation, all the Member States now agree on the value of this and acknowledge the need to inject flexibility into the arrangement for putting it into practice.
Equally, they are all in agreement that these arrangement must remain open and accessible, that there is no question of moving towards a two-speed Europe, that the institutional framework of the Union must be respected and thus, in particular, the role of the Commission and that of the European Parliament, and, lastly, that there is a need to preserve the Community acquis, which is to say the internal market and cohesion policy involving closer cooperation.
Finally, in the field of foreign, security and defence policy, I believe that specially tailored measure must be pinpointed in order to cater for the specific nature of the issue involved.
Concerning the Commission and the re-weighting of votes, two issue which are closely interrelated and politically charged, the discussion revealed a consensus on the need to make the Commission stronger and more effective. Having said that, I must admit that not a great deal wa actually said, because there remains a very marked rift over how this is to be achieved.
Some Member States advocate setting a definitive ceiling on the number of commissioners, in tandem with a rotation of post among the Member States on an equal footing, while others champion a system of one Commissioner per Member State, without ruling out the possibility of a radical restructuring of the college.
Both option remain on the table, and must be assessed in the light of their potential for ensuring that the common interest of the Community are safeguarded.
Concerning the weighting of votes, the two well-known system also remain on the table: a simple re-weighting, in favour of which a narrow, very narrow majority is emerging, or a double majority system, but with alternative options, a double simple or double re-weighted majority, in other word a type of 'demographic safety net' .
It is clear that we will only be able to take a decision on these issue after negotiation have come to a close; nevertheless, discussion based on detailed proposal must continue in order to prepare for the final decision at Nice.
Work will now continue in a very intensive manner up to Nice, on the basis of the informal guideline adopted by this European Council.
We thus have a little under fifty day left.
The preparatory group therefore met yesterday to work on qualified majority voting and on closer cooperation, on very concrete bases.
It also went into greater detail in it work on amending Article 7 of the Treaty in accordance with the positive guideline laid down at Biarritz.
The preparatory group is to play a full role up until 19 November, the date of the next ministerial level meeting.
We will therefore hold a total of six ministerial-level working session between now and Nice. Four of these will be mini-sessions and two will take the form of a conclave, and we expect to turn all these occasion to good account in order to keep alive the Biarritz spirit.
Finally, a word on a related subject, but one which I know to be of fundamental importance for the European Parliament: the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I can tell you that the European Council unanimously commended the quality of this text, which can therefore be formally proclaimed at Nice in the form that it wa transmitted by the Convention.
The matter of it incorporation into the Treaties wa quite rightly not dealt with at Biarritz.
It is nevertheless clear that the majority of Member States are not yet prepared to do this, and it is my belief - this is not my wish, but simply my impression - that it will only be possible to formally raise this issue further down the line.
I will now turn to international issues, which were also very much to the fore at Biarritz.
You will all be aware of the event that were going on at the time this Summit wa held with, on the one hand, the situation in the Middle East, and on the other the political change in Serbia, which found expression in the visit to Biarritz by the new President of Serbia, Mr Kostunica.
I will not dwell on the event in the Middle East.
I will simply point out that, right from the outset, the European Union ha called on both side to strive to put an end to the violence, to reopen dialogue and safeguard what had been achieved at Camp David, and the Biarritz European Council called both side to a summit meeting.
The European Union continued to make it voice heard, the voice of reason and conciliation, at Sharm-el-Sheikh, where it wa represented for the first time by Mr Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP - a fact that I would emphasise a I do not subscribe to the opinion that Europe is playing a diminished role in the Middle East, but actually one that is becoming gradually more important again.
Unfortunately, it ha proved impossible since Sharm-el-Sheikh to implement the agreement worked out there, and the tension on both side remain considerable, to say the least, with the European Union therefore monitoring the situation with the greatest of vigilance.
We must recapture the spirit that reigned in the Oslo Agreements, and this is the ambition of this Presidency, all the Member States, the High Representative, and the Commission and Parliament.
The second event that stood out at Biarritz, for the right reason this time, wa the return of democracy to Serbia and, more than this, the repercussion of the political change in Belgrade on relation between that country and the European Union.
I am sure that the event leading up to the investiture of Vojislav Kostunica will still be fresh in your minds. This investiture and these event have seen a completely new political order being installed in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, opening the way to the democratisation of the country and, let u hope, a more widespread reconciliation in the Balkans.
The European Union ha honoured it commitment and responded to this political turnaround at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 9 October, at which it decided to lift the sanctions, including the oil and air embargoes, imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, with the exception of course of sanction directly aimed at Mr Milosevic and his entourage.
President Kostunica therefore accepted the invitation from the Presidency to go to Biarritz and have lunch with Heads of State and Government.
At the joint press conference he held alongside the French Presidency, Mr Kostunica expressed his heartfelt joy at being welcomed into the European family, for this is exactly what is happening.
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will, of course, very soon benefit from the instrument that have been set in place by the Union to cover the entire Balkan region, beginning with the CARDS programme and also the activity of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
Furthermore, the General Affairs Council confirmed the Union' s intention to contribute to re-establishing navigation on the Danube and to actively participate in modernising infrastructure in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia within a regional context.
Moreover, without prejudice to a need assessment and the coordination of economic and financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which are to be the joint responsibility of the European Commission and the World Bank, the Biarritz European Council decided to grant the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia initial emergency humanitarian aid totalling EUR 200 million.
Lastly, and I will end here - this is without doubt the most important decision in the medium and long term - the Union ha decided to provide this country with a political prospect by proposing that it conclude a stabilisation and association agreement along the line of those currently being negotiated with the other country in the same region.
It wa precisely with this in mind that President Kostunica wa invited, a you will be aware, to take part in the summit meeting between the European Union and the country of the western Balkans, which is to be held in Zagreb, at the instigation of the President of the French Republic, on 24 November.
These are the issue that can be singled out concerning the development and situation in Serbia and their repercussion for the Union.
I feel that the important thing wa for the Union to very swiftly communicate to this country not only a tangible message of encouragement but also, and I would stress this point, the political prospect of it full and comprehensive integration into the European family.
I believe that this message ha been clearly given.
We can only hope that the process of democratisation is able to continue under optimum conditions.
These, in a nutshell, were the result of the Biarritz European Council which was, and I say this in all sincerity because I believe it to be true, highly productive and therefore of great value to the step forward that the Union is of course still to complete.
Madam President, I would now, in turn, like to give the Commission' s impression following the Biarritz European Council, to which you, Madam President, made an active contribution, along with another eminent member of this House, Mrs Méndez de Vigo, who presented the result of work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Moscovici, ha spoken of something that he ha dubbed the 'Biarritz spirit' .
One might talk of the Biarritz spirit or frame of mind, and also the climate at Biarritz.
Ladies and gentlemen, I can truly say that the climate in which discussion took place genuinely matched the climatic condition that prevailed in Biarritz for the two day we were there.
The weather wa cloudy and windy but it was, all thing considered, an invigorating climate and, I felt, just the type of dynamic climate that we needed at that stage of the discussions, in which I myself noticed many stumbling blocks, far more stumbling block than can always be explained away by the delicacy of the issues.
We needed this invigorating climate, a Mr Moscovici ha said, and I too sensed among the Heads of State and of Government a very solemn air of collective and historic responsibility at this historic juncture for European integration.
There seemed to be a genuine sense of purpose and, in any event, the will to achieve real reform at Nice.
Much ha been said, in the press and elsewhere, of the rift between larger States and smaller States, or le populous countries.
These divergence of opinion are a fact.
Everyone is conscious of them, but there is none of the hostility which is sometimes described.
In this connection, I would prefer to talk of a moment of truth in the debate, rather than a moment of crisis.
Above all, I would like to say, a someone who has, from the start and on a daily basis, been involved in these discussion a one of the workmen, alongside your representative Mr Brok and Professor Tsatsos, that this rift is not the only one that might exist between large and small States.
It is not even, it would seem to me, the central issue in these discussion if one recalls, and this is something that must be remembered and recalled, that ever since the process of European integration began, there ha never been a case, either in the Council or within the Commission, of large country forming a coalition against small countries, or of small States forming a coalition against large countries.
This run counter to the spirit of the Community.
As regard my feeling on this matter, I am aware of and understand the sensitivity of the issue that the Minister ha described, issue which directly relate to the position, the role, and the influence of each country.
I perceived this sensitivity during the visit I made to each of the Member States, and also last week in Athens, with regard both to the Commission, with each country concerned at the position that would be assigned to it, and to the voting system, with each country concerned at the number of vote it is to have in the Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must find a solution to these two issues, which will in fact only be resolved when negotiation are complete, and on which we must reach total agreement if that agreement is to mean anything at all.
With regard to the Commission, a solution must be found that preserve it effectiveness, it credibility, and if possible it collegiate nature.
With regard to the voting system, we must find a solution which respect - a both the Commission and the European Parliament have proposed - the twofold legitimacy of, on the one hand, the Member States and, on the other, the people of Europe.
But if I had to tell you spontaneously and very sincerely how I felt, I would say this: regardless of the sensitivity of these issue - the composition of the Commission and the voting system - they cannot be used a criterion for assessing whether Nice is a success or a failure.
The success or failure of the Nice Council will depend on the ability of the Heads of State and Government, and on the ability of Parliament and the Commission, a party to the negotiations, to preserve or consolidate the Community model.
In saying this, lady and gentlemen, I have in mind a number of point that are still under discussion.
Whether the Community system is preserved or weakened will depend on the scope of qualified majority voting and thus of codecision being extended to cover real issues.
That is my first point.
The preservation or strengthening of the Community model will be assessed on the basis of whether we have been able to resist the temptation felt by some to call into question the exclusivity of the Commission' s power to initiate legislation.
I am referring here to Article 250, for which some would like to introduce qualified majority voting.
The preservation and consolidation of the Community system will be assessed on the basis of whether the Commission ha been reserved a fitting role in closer cooperation, and not only a concern the first pillar.
The consolidation of the Community system will be assessed on the basis of whether the role of agency ha been allowed to develop to the detriment of the regulatory authority that belongs to the Commission.
That, lady and gentlemen, from my viewpoint a someone who, let me repeat in all modesty, is one of the humble workman in these discussions, is what I say and think is the way to gauge whether or not genuine reform ha been achieved in Nice.
I would like to follow what the Minister ha said by quickly touching on some of the point that I have just mentioned.
Qualified majority voting: I would stress that the issue is not really about how many field could be changed from unanimity to qualified majority voting.
The real issue is the status of these fields, and the great merit of the Biarritz Summit will have been that of defining the most problematic area and encouraging us, or authorising us, to find technical solution for taxation issues, or in any case for the small section of taxation policy, or of social protection, which relates directly to the internal market.
There is a need to reassure those who are worried that under no circumstance will the sovereignty of the Member States in taxation matter be challenged, and to also tell those who have worry that the idea is not to merge social protection systems, especially from the bottom up, but simply to see to it that the common market and the single market run smoothly within an enlarged Europe.
Trade policy, asylum and immigration, cohesion policy, environmental policy: in each of these field several approach to solution have been sounded out and, a early a yesterday morning, the group of representative wa back at work.
Following on from what Mr Moscovici ha said, I would like to state that the Commission is no mere bystander in this work.
It is playing it part and is ready and willing, alongside the Presidency, to seek out the fairest solutions.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must quite simply see to it that from now on we keep alive the spirit and climate of Biarritz a regard these qualified majority voting issues.
Naturally, a regard all these areas, where the transition to qualified majority voting is involved, I would like to reiterate our intention to extend codecision where legislative matter are concerned.
As Mr Moscovici ha said, genuine progress ha also been made concerning closer cooperation.
It is interesting to note that many delegation feel that we have to turn this progress on closer cooperation to good account, and this is along the line of what I wa saying earlier, in order to strengthen the role of the Community institution - the role of the Commission, but also that of Parliament.
I feel that the fundamental demand made by Parliament and the Commission will be met or honoured, and that on this point we will manage to secure the abolition of recourse to the European Council, which is to say the right of veto, along with a lowering of the quorum to one third, or eight, of the Member States in Community matters.
It wa made eminently clear at Biarritz that closer cooperation would constitute an additional force for integration and not an instrument of exclusion.
I also feel that an agreement could be reached on another theme, on Article 7, taking a a basis or a pointer the proposal that the Commission itself made to provide for vigorous Community dialogue on legal matters, and Community and political control of crisis situation in which we might find ourselves due to the stance that one government or another adopts with regard to our common values.
Mr Moscovici ha spoken of the Charter.
In drafting this instrument, work of high quality ha been carried out in an original and intelligent manner.
I feel that it will go on to be proclaimed at Nice, and this already mark a great step forward.
We cannot stop there and at Nice we will need to envisage way of addressing the place that this Charter is to have within the Treaties.
Let u not wait until after Nice to consider the post-Nice scenario regarding a number of issue of a constitutional nature: that of the role of the Charter, and thus of the formal consolidation of citizens' rights, that of the simplification of the Treaties, on which we have worked with the Institute of Florence, that of the clarification or focussing of competences, so that we can finally say who is doing what within the European Union, what the Union is or is not doing, or what it should stop doing.
These are issue that we do not have time to deal with thoroughly prior to Nice, but they must be raised and would perhaps merit in-depth attention after Nice.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are still a great many thorny issue in these complex negotiation which can only be resolved by universal agreement. I would like to confirm that the Biarritz spirit or the Biarritz climate would seem to me to have been primarily one of determination.
We are still some way off an agreement, but I would like, a regard the determined support the Commission offer you, to give a clear reminder, if there could be any doubts, concern or question surrounding this, that the Commission will strive to the very last minute - you can count on me - to set itself very ambitious target for the Treaty of Nice in these negotiations, so that we will not simply be concluding the negotiation at Nice, but first and foremost ensuring their success.
Madam President, I will quickly mention some other issues, if I may, to confirm or expand upon what the Presidency ha said.
First, Serbia.
Everyone here ha been deeply moved and heartened by the move to democracy in Serbia - firstly by the will of the people of Serbia and by the election of President Kostunica a President of the Yugoslav Federation.
This is what ha caused the European Union to radically alter it policy in respect of Serbia.
I must say that President Kostunica' s visit to Biarritz wa an important and moving event which marked the return of Serbia to the European fold.
In more practical terms, we announced that emergency aid totalling EUR 200 million had been allocated to Serbia, and the Commission is soon to present a package of emergency measure that will cater for the country' s priority need a winter approaches.
Besides the emergency aid, there can be no doubt that Serbia will also need, a Mr Moscovici ha indicated, more comprehensive support, which will be implemented in association with the World Bank and the EIB among others.
The key thing, here a elsewhere, I feel, is to consolidate democracy.
The President-in-Office of the Council mentioned about the Middle East.
I will not dwell on this issue except to remind you that the European Council adopted a declaration that exerted pressure on both side in the conflict to actually meet at Sharm-el-Sheikh.
This meeting did indeed take place.
We are aware of what wa achieved there and we too feel that it wa important that Javier Solana, the European Union' s High Representative, should play an active part in these talks.
I would like to conclude by mentioning two issue that are of concern to this House and which have spurred the Commission to take action - crude oil and maritime safety.
These issue were also dealt with at Biarritz. The Heads of State and Government welcomed the proposal from the Commission, presented by Loyola de Palacio, for a global strategy on oil reserve and oil prices.
The President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, took the opportunity to emphasise, above and beyond the content of this Communication, the vital importance of Russia to this debate, and suggested that we discus this issue thoroughly at the forthcoming summit meeting between the European Union and Russia in Paris on 30 October.
Lastly, on the subject of maritime safety and the lesson to be learned from the Erika disaster, a few month ago the European Council ratified the guideline we had proposed, and which were presented to you, on Community strategy in the field of maritime safety.
As you know, these centre around three basic objectives: stepping up inspection of ship in port, stringent monitoring of classification society and implementing a timetable throughout the Union for replacing single-hulled oil tankers.
The French Presidency is determined to carry through the necessary reform in this field before the year is out and, on the basis of the proposal from the Commission, to inject fresh impetus into this area at the Nice European Council.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, the moment of truth ha arrived.
We have to make decision in Nice to avoid endangering enlargement, which is our main priority.
The President-in-Office of the Council ha spoken of the spirit of Nice.
We must not kill the spirit of Nice with boredom, and we therefore have an essential priority in the remaining 50 days: to bring negotiation to a political level.
It would be better if this were done publicly a in the case of the Convention, but in any event, we cannot once again restructure the Intergovernmental Conference, which ha been treading water for nine month without making any progress at all.
With regard to the report by the President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament ha no essential criticisms.
We can be nice for once.
There is one basic issue, however, that I would like the President-in-Office of the Council to clarify.
The Commissioner ha talked about qualified majority and codecision.
The President-in-Office of the Council ha not.
Our understanding is that the relationship is automatic: anything voted upon by qualified majority in the Council must immediately also be subject to codecision with Parliament.
I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could clarify this point.
Secondly, I would also ask him to clarify for the Assembly whether the distribution of seat in Parliament is currently a topic for debate at the Intergovernmental Conference, because here we are doing nothing but criticise the Council - which sometimes give u ample cause for criticism - but we must not neglect our own responsibilities.
I have already publicly condemned, here in this Chamber, our inability to distribute the small increase to 700 seats.
I think we can also set an example, a we have done in the past, by distributing between large and small countries.
I also think that we are not currently fulfilling our responsibility if we are not capable of solving this problem.
I am particularly addressing the group that are blocking this decision in Parliament, starting with the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Then there is the matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
If we all agree that the Charter is a very important document, which we all support and which, furthermore, is a symbol of collective identity, I cannot understand what we are going to do with the Charter.
Are we going to keep it in a box?
Are we going to save it for a rainy day?
In my opinion, it should be the frontispiece of a future Constitution, but at the moment, what we could do and what could easily be achieved in Nice, is to include the Charter in the Treaty by mean of an extremely simple link: Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union.
I would ask the Commission and the Council to make a statement on this matter.
This is an important topic for current and future Member States.
In this respect I would also like to address my colleague in the European People' s Party - and I would ask Mr Poettering to listen to me - because what we advocate in this Assembly, we should also advocate outside it.
It is also absolutely unacceptable that Mr Berlusconi' s party in the Italian Parliament voted against this Charter and that a Member of this Assembly used coarse, pre or post-fascist language in relation to the Charter.
We must be coherent and uphold the Charter here and in our own national parliaments.
We must do so because these value are essential for everyone.
In this respect, I would also ask that a clear announcement be made regarding the proposal we are making, a we believe it make political sense.
In conclusion, Madam President, two final comment regarding fundamental matter of external policy.
On the one hand, the presence of President Kostunica wa an historic event.
The important thing is that we help the Balkans to achieve stability, not instability.
To this end, I believe that we should apply the same standard to all.
We cannot ask Croatia to cooperate with the International Court and not demand the same of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
We must find money - and here the Council ha responsibility - to assert our community of value and create a balanced, stabilising policy in the Balkans.
With regard to the Middle East, it is clear that one of the cause of the situation - not the only cause, a this matter is far more complex - is that the European Union in the past wa vetoed a a potential mediator.
The step that ha been taken should be applauded, although it wa in a situation in which responsibility had to be shared.
I believe that we must honour our commitment in one of the most tragic situation we are experiencing today.
Madam President, firstly I praise the European Council for accepting the draft Charter a definitive.
From what we know of the performance of the Prime Ministers and Presidents at Biarritz on the trickiest question of Treaty reform, the Charter will probably become the greatest trophy at Nice.
So why is the French Presidency trying to suppress the question of the installation of the Charter within the Treaty?
President Chirac, with his usual capacity for surprise, said in his press statement that the Charter' s legal status would be a question for the Swedish Presidency.
What doe that mean?
What on earth is Sweden supposed to achieve that France cannot?
Surely it is for the European Council at Nice to consider whether the Charter should be inserted inside the Treaty.
That is what the IGC is for.
I would urge the French Presidency quickly to reassess it position on that central point.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the enlargement of the Union is a mean of increasing stability and safety in Europe and of promoting tolerance and democracy.
However, it is just a vital that there is reform of the Union' s institution so a to ensure that the stability of the Union itself doe not go under in a climate of indecisiveness on the one hand and public indifference and repugnance on the other.
This would require majority decision in the Council to become the rule, and likewise, codecision for Parliament, in agricultural matters, for example.
I welcome the declaration of fundamental rights, but it ha to be improved in order to better accommodate the citizens' expectations, and it ha to form part of a European constitutional process.
It must be integrated in the Treaty.
The development of a credible and democratic Europe requires more involvement from the citizens, the regions, the small and large Member States, more decisiveness on the part of the Commission and a reinforcement of the role of Parliament, but especially the will of the Commission to play it role on behalf of the Union, and this is what we failed to do in the Middle East, for example.
Peace must be achieved for the sake of those killed, especially on the Palestinian side and, in order to recover the spirit of Oslo, we must go back to basics.
Israel is entitled to peace and safety but the Palestinians, who had to give up a large part of their land for this, are entitled to their own state, a enshrined in UN resolution 242 and 338.
The election of Mr Kostunica is without a doubt a sign of hope to all democrats, but at the same time, the issue of future stability push themselves to the fore in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, for peace in the Balkans is fragile and we will need, with immediate effect, to have the mean at our disposal to secure reconstruction and future stability in a democratic process.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, while progress ha been made on closer cooperation and the extension of qualified majority voting, deep-seated disagreement persists, a you yourself have underlined, concerning the composition of the Commission and the weighting of vote in Council.
It is indeed a fact that there are still major difference of opinion between larger country and the smaller countries, which fear the stronger country setting up a type of cabinet.
So, in speaking of the Biarritz spirit, I believe that in essence Biarritz reflects the complexity of the challenge facing the Union.
I view it a expressing, along the line of other summits, even if it wa an informal one, the contradiction that exist between social requirement and citizens' demands, the expectation of the people of Europe, and the free-market rationale that continues to hold sway in the European Union.
There is a pressing need to work out a new design for an enlargement that unites rather than divides, that involves the candidate country in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and pay far greater attention to the social dimension of enlargement.
I would therefore reiterate my Group' s commitment to a reform that guarantee balance between the European institution and also between the Member States, and in doing so smaller country being marginalised.
A reform that also increase transparency and democracy and at last enables the general public to participate in the drafting of European policies.
Biarritz also saw the unanimous adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, yes, there wa indeed great ambition and a novel method.
For the first time in a document of this type, civil, political and social right were placed on an equal footing, with a commitment to establishing a Community of human values.
I do not for all that share in the Presidency' s satisfaction, and can only regret the fact that the content of the Charter fails to live up to requirement and expectations, not least a regard social issues.
I would also express the wish of my Group and of a good many NGOs to see the Charter evolve and continue to improve, in order to guarantee, amongst other things, more effective protection and right for the citizen of the European Union, for employees, for the citizen of third country and for the socially marginalised.
The Council would truly satisfy the expectation of European citizen if it were to launch a widespread consultation of individual community and national parliaments, culminating in a charter that genuinely met people' s needs.
Finally, concerning international issues, I, like others here, am keen to hail the return of democracy to Serbia.
It is very important, a part of the process that ha started, for the Union to contribute to the reconstruction, stability and promotion of human right in all the country of the former Yugoslavia.
Concerning the Middle East, all the sign following Sharm-el-Sheikh are that the peace process depends on certain undertaking being honoured, beginning with the full and comprehensive implementation of the UN resolutions, an end to Israeli colonisation of the occupied territories, the right of displaced Palestinians to return to their lands, and the recognition of a Palestinian state which ha East Jerusalem a it capital.
I too hope that Nice European Council is a success and welcome the fact that the people of Europe, and large number of associations, NGOs and trade union are investing time and effort in preparing for it.
Madam President, at the Biarritz Council we saw emerging, from behind the real or supposed quarrel between larger and smaller countries, a different but equally real type of rift between those who want to speed up European integration and those who want to preserve a design for a European Union that respect Member States and national democracies.
The first group would seem willing to engage in ultrafederalism within a hard core of States, and the referendum in Denmark seems to have strengthened their conviction on this.
My Group would like to warn them against this.
By persisting in this approach, they would probably cut Europe in half, and even more surely would cut themselves off from their own nation.
For the referendum held on 28 September wa not simply an expression of the Danes' refusal to be run by a European superstate and their desire to preserve their national democracy.
It also mirrored the feeling of many citizen in other Member States, even if these feeling are sometimes more abstract given the lack of a mean to convey them.
Were their voice heard at Biarritz?
One might well doubt it, in view of the fact that the most clear-cut decision taken during the Biarritz Council wa to proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights at Nice.
The ultimate goal of this Charter, should it become binding, would be to strip each national democracy of the right to itself determine the right and duty of it own citizens.
Worse still, the major concern of those promoting the Charter actually seems to be how to make it binding without first having it ratified by the national parliaments.
The decision that it will be proclaimed at Nice ha already been taken solely by the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
The Commission subsequently informed us, in it Communication of 11 October, that the Charter could be rendered binding through the case law of the Court of Justice, still without any say from the national parliaments.
It will therefore have been possible to strip the nation of Europe of their most fundamental right without ever openly having asked their citizen for an opinion.
It is thus impossible to claim that Biarritz genuinely listened to the demand, a expressed in the referendum in Denmark, that national democracy be respected within the Union.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, lady and gentlemen, I do not share Commissioner Barnier' s optimism about maintaining the Community system at Nice.
It seems to me that we are moving in the opposite direction.
We had a second pillar, then we had a third pillar, and now we are in the process of constructing a fourth pillar on defence, while a de facto fifth pillar also exists on economic and monetary union.
On the other hand, the major point of balance between European institution are slowly being broken down.
We have a Commission that is weakened and, rather than dealing with such fundamental issues, Parliament is waxing lyrical on somewhat surreal themes, such a a charter that ha absolutely no legal basis and which no authority will be entrusted with enforcing, when all of our fifteen Member States have their own charter of fundamental rights.
While this Parliament hold forth on constitutionalisation, the real issue is - and I would stress this - that of the balance of power within the Commission.
I cannot agree with you, Mr Poettering.
The issue is one of not turning the Commission into a second Council by ensuring that each Member State is represented. The issue is that of turning the Commission into a genuine supranational body, an authority for the European Union.
These change can of course only work to the disadvantage of the smaller States, a might be suspected judging from the manoeuvring of some larger States, who are banking on scenario for the reweighting of vote and the composition of the Commission and speculating on the future composition of the Commission in order to earn themselves a little extra room for manoeuvre with regard to reweighting.
The real issue is that of giving the Commission, by mean of elections, a genuine legitimacy that relates directly to the citizens.
The only way to make Commission stronger is to have the President of the Commission elected by direct universal suffrage and also - why not? - the Vice-President with responsibility for external relations, in order to at last remove this area from the second pillar.
This is the only way to restore a true balance between the various institution of the European Union.
But we refuse to talk about such things.
We bring the question of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into our nation-oriented arguments, but fail to consider the fact that the future of Europe hinge on a Commission that is able to represent all it citizen and not the Member States a in the past, and one that ha not been transformed - along the line sketched out today - into a second Council, where all sort of haggling become possible and no authentic expression of common European is able to emerge.
We must therefore urge everyone to return to the root of our Union, to have the courage that Giscard d' Estaing and Helmut Schmidt showed when deciding on the election of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage in 1976 and in 1979, and to decide that in 2009 we will finally have a President of the Commission who is also the President of the European Union.
Madam President, the Biarritz Summit wa a breakthrough for reinforced cooperation.
The heart of the matter is that the élites who are keenest on integration want to be able to make decision without broad democratic support.
There is no longer any need to take account of those country in which referendum are required before sovereignty is handed over.
In future, it will be possible to have proposal rejected in referendum and adopt them in any case.
Any country which vote against will sooner or later be pressurised into following suit.
The pattern is familiar from cooperation on issue of legal policy.
First of all, the pioneering country implement a form of Schengen-style cooperation, and the legislation is subsequently transferred to all the countries.
The most stubborn country are made a special offer.
They can have the legislation sent to them by fax without exercising any contributory influence.
What they cannot do is avoid the legislation, no matter how many people vote no in the referendums.
Elites in all the country are also joining force against their own voters.
Those who stand apart from reinforced cooperation are really being given the same freedom a the back seat passenger in a car.
Reinforced cooperation is like an eel trap. There is no way back, but only ever more integration, more centralisation and more Brussels, without the corresponding democracy.
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities want to see a freer and more flexible Europe in which there is no pressure to be a part of every development and which is characterised by democracy instead of regimentation: a Europe of democracy and diversity.
Madam President, I still remember well the pitying smile of those delegate who favoured an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference, when I suggested to them back in February this year that we could count ourselves lucky if it proved possible to find a solution to the famous Amsterdam leftovers.
What stage are we at now, eight month on and with the Biarritz Summit behind us?
Apart from hoping to make progress in the matter of extending qualified majority voting, in truth we have not made a great deal of headway.
A new Treaty is just a distant a prospect today a it wa eight month ago.
Indeed it is clear that the question of the leftover is going to be a fairly hard nut to crack. There is no prospect of any agreement to my mind.
However, if no solution is found to the key issues, then it will not be possible for work which is at a more advanced stage - for example with regard to the reform of the European Court of Justice - to be included in a new Treaty.
Similarly, the stock phrase used by the French, that it is better to have no treaty than a bad one, is unlikely to reinforce anyone' s faith in the attainability of an ambitious goal in Nice.
. (FR) Madam President, I would like to contribute to this debate by recapitulating on some of the interventions, rather than by replying to them.
I have very little to add to what Commissioner Barnier ha said, except perhaps to mention a slight difference of opinion over meteorology.
The weather at Biarritz wa in fact quite bad that weekend.
I know the Basque coast very well and wa rather disappointed for those participating.
One might have expected somewhat better weather conditions, but I feel that the climate inside the European Council, at which I wa present from start to finish, wa a little better than the Commissioner ha said.
In this respect I would like to respond to what Mr Poettering ha said about the rift between the larger and smaller states.
It is true that we arrived at a juncture where marked difference of opinion were evident in the ministerial discussions.
The intention of the Presidency was, on the contrary, to help ensure that this debate could go ahead in an open manner, in such a way a to enable u to move on from it, without the very same rift opening up again. Judging from the feedback on the most crucial discussion, the one that took place when the Heads of State and Government met for dinner, it did indeed force matter into the open so that solution could then be sought.
You can in any case rest assured, Mr President, that it is the genuine desire of the Presidency of the Council to seek out a compromise that suit everyone.
Accordingly, the President of the French Republic, the President of the European Council and the French Prime Minister asked me to visit, before the President of the French Republic, the ten country which are currently asking for only one commissioner.
I immediately went to see the Belgian Prime Minister yesterday evening and moreover believe that he too can sense the Biarritz spirit.
The determination to heal the rift between the smaller and larger country is an integral part of this spirit.
I do not, in this respect, share the feeling of the Chairman of the Group of the European People' s Party on the possibility of 'one Commissioner per Member State' .
I am aware of the criticism that you have addressed to the German Chancellor.
I am no more qualified than you to meddle in German internal affairs, but feel that this position is extremely consistent and if I am not mistaken also move into line with what the Commission wants.
A strong and effective Commission mean a Commission that ha even greater legitimacy by virtue of representing the general interest of the Community, and not by dint of a perceived intrusion of the intergovernmental phenomenon into the way it operates.
When we proposed a rotation on an equal footing, it wa precisely to show that the idea wa not to pit the smaller and larger country against one other but that, in a Commission with a ceiling on commissioners, those country which we incorrectly refer to a 'large' and those that we equally incorrectly call 'small' would be represented on a perfectly equal footing.
This is the clear position of the French delegation, and this is clearly the preferable solution.
What I noted in Brussels yesterday, wa that an idea is beginning to gain credence, that of having one Commissioner per Member State, which will probably be adopted at Nice, perhaps placing a ceiling on the number of commissioner at a later date.
I therefore believe that we will clear up this ambiguity and that we must do so while effectively ensuring that the Commission continues to be a strong body.
In fact, a Mr Barnier ha said extremely clearly, a Commission packed to the rafter and representing the Member States alone would lose credibility and legitimacy.
I share the Commissioner' s views.
The objective is truly one of strengthening the Community framework.
In order to do this, I would reiterate, in the same vein a my response to Mr Prodi at our last meeting, that we must upgrade each of the institutions: the Commission of course, the European Parliament of course, and the Council too.
This is the balance that we must strike.
I would also like to reassure Mr Poettering a to the action of the French Prime Minister.
The day after Biarritz, the Prime Minister, a some of those present can testify, appeared in person - something that doe not always happen - and at length before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the parliamentary body that brings together member of the national parliaments, the European parliament and the parliament of candidate countries.
Furthermore, the French Parliament held an hour-long question session that wa broadcast at peak viewing time and wa specifically dedicated to topical European issues, and thus to the result of the Biarritz European Council, during which the Prime Minister spoke at length. You know how thing work in the media.
You might say something on Monday or Tuesday, but this doe not necessarily mean that you will be questioned about it on the Thursday. You can therefore rest assured of the French Prime Minister' s resolve a regard this Presidency issue.
I would like to briefly return to matter of external trade policy, a this is a very serious matter.
France' s stance on this is no secret, and neither are the position of a number of other Member States who feel that, when it come to the field of services, especially cultural matter and even more particularly audiovisual matters, a cautious approach is called for since issue of identity come into play, and I am talking about issue of identity and not exceptions.
Mr Barón Crespo asked several question which primarily concern the link between qualified majority voting and codecision.
I am aware that this is an issue which the European Parliament quite rightly view a very important, and must make clear to the House that I only dealt with the bare bone of the issue of course, given the limited speaking time available to me, but that this issue doe not present any difficulties.
Moreover, a I to some extent hinted at during our debate prior to Biarritz, the Presidency see the extension of qualified majority voting a going hand in hand with codecision.
As I am sure everyone here will be pleased to hear, that doe not currently constitute a problem area for the Intergovernmental Conference.
I would also like to return to the issue of the number of Members of the European Parliament.
This issue wa partially settled at Amsterdam in Article 189 of the Treaty, which set a ceiling of 700 MEPs.
We have started to exchange idea on this question, from which it ha emerged that all the Member States want to maintain this ceiling after enlargement.
One delicate issue is still to be resolved, that of how to allocate seat within this ceiling.
I can state that a number of delegations, those from Germany, Britain, France and Italy and also from Holland, would like to see a proportional reduction and others a linear reduction.
We shall have to see, a this will clearly be a sensitive issue.
I would just like to express my disappointment at the fact that the European Parliament ha dispensed with drawing up the report that it had announced and which wa to have been the subject of an oral question today.
Indeed I feel that this would have helped the Member States and not least the Council to form an opinion, a no one could have more definite idea on this matter than the Members of the European Parliament themselves.
Perhaps it is not too late to do this.
I will end with the question asked by virtually all the speaker concerning the binding nature of the Charter, and am anxious to make myself clearly understood on his matter.
Firstly, all the member of the European Council are happy with the Charter, both from the standpoint of the method used and from that of it content.
I will very quickly repeat that the Convention method is an innovative one which enables several legitimate authority to be combined, the national parliaments, the European Parliament, the Commission and the governments. It is therefore something on which we could perhaps draw in the future when addressing other issues.
The content of this Charter could indeed be interpreted in several different ways: the glass is either half full or half empty, it is a compromise.
I see this compromise a a rather dynamic, gradual and progressive one.
This text will stand out because it is clear and because it is accessible.
It is the first European Union document that the citizen can consult without feeling completely alienated from it content.
That really is something valuable, a wa emphasised by all the member of the European Council.
There remains, of course, the question of it legal power.
I will make no secret of the fact that we are engaged in a process, one in which we are well versed, of having the Charter proclaimed by each of the three institutions.
It ha to be said that within the European Council there are a number of delegations, and I might even say a large number of delegations, that are opposed to the Charter being binding in nature, and therefore to it being incorporated into the Treaties a early a Nice.
Given the circumstances, how could one possibly imagine that this constitutes a forward development?
We will strive for this change, a our Presidential role dictates, but I would not want to lead Parliament to believe that development that cannot come about will come about.
I do not think it will happen.
It seems to me that we must adopt a gradual approach to this matter: see to it that this Charter is proclaimed at Nice by the three institution and then go into it legal future since I, like many people here, believe that it will indeed be the preamble to a future constitutional treaty, but let u then address this a a constituent issue.
In reality only one process or one procedure is still to be addressed and that is the reference to Article 6.
I have already had occasion in this House to tell you that I wa in favour of this.
Little wa said about the issue at the European Council, but I had the impression that one delegation - you can probably guess which - wa reticent, a it is opposed to the Charter having any legal effect or being in any way binding.
Lastly, in response to Mrs Ainardi, I see it a very difficult and even quite dangerous to open up the Charter package and discus it content again, a I do not know what the end result of this re-examination would be.
I strongly believe that this would be taking a step backwards rather than a step forwards.
Now that we have this Charter, let u accept it for what it is, a the stage we have reached today, a first step that is subsequently to be confirmed and developed by taking others, whether in respect of it content or it legal status.
Madam President, the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council give me the opportunity to remind him of two things: first, that this Parliament - a far a I know - ha not given up on drafting a report on the number of Members of this Parliament in the Treaties. In other words, we might yet please him by providing this report he is so keen on.
Secondly, the position of this Parliament ha never been that the Charter wa to be the preamble to the Treaties.
